Why in the hell would someonekeep a box of blanketsin the garage?What's the practicaluse in that?You're in bed, you're cold,you come out to the evencolder garage to get a blanket?- Eh, I don't know.- I know you don't know,because you wouldn't do that,because it's astupid thing to do!That's the one percentin action right there!This is why our country'sin the shitter!Hey, now!If that's not a secrethidin' spot!- Oh, it's locked.- Exactly, because there'svaluable stuff in here.- Hey, whoa, no!- What?- You're gonna breakeverything inside!- But it's locked!- So, we'll find the key.- But we justfound this!- Perfect, so we're on a roll.This house is just too damnbig, that's the real problem.- Yeah, if you're robbing it,but if you're living here,it's probably pretty nice.- It's

shit.This fits in my bag, it'sgotta be worth something.- It's just a lamp.- Yeah, but it's old and cool!You've seen those showswhere people find weird stuffand it turns out to beworth a bundle.I saw this one where thisguy had an old spittoon,turned out to belongto some famous cowboyor somethin', $100,000.- Cowboys didn't have lamps.- It doesn't haveto be a cowboy,that's not the important part.It's just that, generally, oldthings are,you know, can be, uh, um.I don't knowall the specific rules,but this is old andfunky and you never know!- Uh, I do, ehm.I'm telling you, it's wortha

deposit.- You've gotta bekidding me!- Neither of us eventhought about the ring,and then I did, and I thought,well, if I realize it,then she realizes it,and she'll bring it back soon.And then she didn't,and then I thought,well, maybe thatmeans something.Maybe she's not ready to let go,and then she got engaged,and then that wasthe last straw.- This is the saddest heistin the long,storied history of crime.- No, it's not,it's the perfect crime!I get my ring back,you get to steal hisstupid rich guy's stuff.- Except that.- That's not his, that'shers, I gave that to her.- Even better,you

to go to the bathroom.- How bad?- Pretty bad.- Ok, let's, um,let's tear a little holein the sheet around her, uh--- I'm not doingthat, that's super rapey!- That's not rapey, it's,we're being courteous!Ok, you have to goto the bathroom?That's no one's fault.We appreciate that you,uh, didn't soil the bed.That shows a lot of respect.Not towards us, specifically,but just, you know,general respect towardshumankind and,uh, societal norms.So that's a good trust-buildingmove, am I right?- Sure.- Ok, so, you showedsome respect,we will do likewise and un-tapeyou, ok?- Yes, please.- But just

don'trun away.- I'm not gonna run away,I'm in my underwear!- Who cares, Cindy birdsongjumped out of a moving vehicleon the long beachfreeway to avoid capture.A little panty dash is nothin'.- Who is Cindy birdsong?- One of the supremes.- Why do you know that?- 'Cause I'm an educated person,come on!- What, both of you?- Fine, I'll go.- Ok, because I have to gonumber two.- Fine, we'll flipfor it.- Heads.- Hey, um,you can have a littlebit of dignity anyhow.Let's see, what else?That'll help a little,but you gotta give methe mercy flush.- What?- Just, well, as soon as it,you know,hits the water, justget rid of it, flush it.Now is now the timefor water conservation.- Ok.- Let's see, she normallyhas a lavender ,people have lavender spray, so.You do that, and I'll use these,and that'll, uh, mask

the noise, it's,you don't even hear it.It's not like somethingelse anymore,it's just,it's the only thing there is.It's terrifying.And then someone holds your handand her skinand the air,and this noise.It's everything, you know,everything.You've got it all in your hand.It's the happiest we ever were,and she's kept me here with her,you see?So I'm staying.The lamp stays.I'm going to look for

a real life onceand it was prettyfuckin' thrilling.- Ok, look.Hawaii is a long flight.They have to get theirbaggage, there's the cab ride.We've got some time.- To do what, we either getcaught by her,or we trip the alarm andget caught by the cops!- I choose the cops.- Are you serious?- If we get caughtby her,she's gonna call thecops, it all ends in cops!- Not if we talk our wayout of it.- How

fireless fire?- We just go, trip the alarm,and, uh, hide in the trees.- Ok.- Cops come, look around,think it's a false alarm,and then, uh, we get outta here.- All right, that's progress,but we're still inside the gate.The whole community is fencedin, we're like zoo animals.- So we just climb the fence.- Ok, uh, if we can,that would put us insideanother gated community.- I, who arethese peopletrying to protectthemselves from, each other?Other marauding gangs of Volvodrivers we don't know about?- We need the code.- I've looked everywhere.- Well, maybe it's inthe garage, that lockbox?-

Walker?- I'm not a dog Walker.- See?- All right, they show up,you're gagged and bound,so you're just a fellow victimof this senseless crime.- You're the ones wholocked us in,I'm just looking for a way out!- Devious, very, very devious!- Why are your clothes off?- Look, it was just one idea.Probably not the bestone, can we just move on?- But why are they ripped?- Again, the clock is ticking,let's not waste timereliving past mistakes.If I needed toand only if they were notbuying my story, I might havehad to go with more of a,kind of a sexual assault angle.- What?- Devious, dirty little--- ok, looking at itfrom your perspective,I can see how that was probablytoo far.- Probably?- Definitely, definitelytoo far,and I'm so glad it didn't cometo that,but you know,there are always, like,a couple clunkers whenyou're brainstorming.- What, we weren'tbrainstorming!You were setting us upfor charges of kidnapping,of, uh, assault and battery,and rape!- And burglary.- That doesn't concern meright now.- Well, that's wherewe're back to, burglary.- I haven't taken anything,so breaking and entering, maybe.- We didn't breakanything, we used the key.We did stain the rug, butthat's not technically broken.- The point is,we're in trouble!- But trouble isjust an opportunitythat got turned around,am I right?- Yeah.- What kind of fortunecookie bullshit is that?- That's not bullshit, thatis solid, deep thinking!- Hey, fish, uh, you know whereyou found everything else?- What about it?- Are you sure you didn'tmiss anything?- Yes, I'm sure I didn'tmiss anything!I don't need the accusations,thank you very much.- Worth looking at, though.- What, eh, wh-why areyou taking her side?- I'm not takin' anyone's side,I'm just sayin' it'sworth double-checking.- Ugh, that's fucked up!- I can't feel anything.- Told ya.- Get way back in there.- I am!- Maybe we shouldget a flashlight,is there a flashlight anywh--what is this?- Nothing, it's, it'snot what you think it is!- What do I think it is?- Oh my god!- I don't know.- All right, give!- Oh, fuck!- I just didn't think youneeded the distraction!We're trying to get outof here, y'know, so I.- Holy shit!- Sometimes I wakeup and think Leo is therein the bed beside me, and myheart sinks when I realize.He used to say,"trouble is just an opportunitythat got turned around,"but I don't know if I'llever get turned back around.Poor Carl walked in on me cryingduring a documentary aboutNiagara Falls.Everything, every feelingwas still right there.I wish I could just have atomato juice and calm down.It worked for Leo,I'd have to drink abouta gallon at this point.Things got tough with Leo,and I wasn't a good person,so maybe I was never a goodperson in the first place.I know that now.- Why would she cut outthe pages of her own.- All that time withJessica, I never ,she dumped you, left.I'm still here, always.We've been talkin' aboutthis heist for foreverand, you know,a little bit of excitement.Doin' our own thing, someteamwork, but,now it's just the same shit!You had Jessica,now you have her!- Her?She's gonna tell thecops that I raped her!- I believe I apologized.- This is the whole reasonthat we broke in here.- No, it's the wholereason you broke in here!- This is crazy, this, thischanges everything!She still...I know the code.- What?- I know the code,it's our anniversary.- No, you don't know!- No, I know!- No, you don't know!You're gonna fuck aroundand get us all arrestedjust 'cause you read somecotton candy thoughtsin her little girl diary,but you don't know the code!- Ok, now,we haven't been at our best,any of us,and maybe someday,we'll all sit down,break bread and have ourapologies and tender momentsand whatnot and that'll be nice,I'm sure.But right now, this is over.I'm getting us out of here,because I know.There.Now, let's go.- Fuck!- What, that can't be--let's go, we gotta run,hide in the bushes!- I don't understand!- We're fucked, we run,let's go!- Wait, we have to stay!- What are you, nuts?- No,
