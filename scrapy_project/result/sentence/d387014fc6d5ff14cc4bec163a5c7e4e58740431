狼园城堡  德国   1934年
Over here!
I'm afraid it's true.
His Royal Highness has struggled.
And whilst Her Majesty's desire to have  her son be the first heir to the throne
to attend a normal school is laudable,
and we were delighted  to have His Royal Highness at Cheam...
we should not delude ourselves...
that it has been entirely successful.
Thank you.
The press run stories  about him almost daily.
The other boys read about him  in the newspapers.
They see his detective.
We do what we can, but...
boys that age can be cruel.
The fact is,  His Royal Highness is different.
And not just because of who he is,  who his parents are.
He's uncommonly shy. Sensitive.
Delicate.
So, if you're asking me where,  in my professional opinion,
he should go to senior school...
Yes, I am.
I would say that in Eton College,  you have the perfect solution.
Right on your doorstep.
Look, Charles!
Look, you'll be so much closer to us.
The weekends, you can just  run up the hill and you'll be with us all.
And you can sleep  in your own bed.
I have to ask Daddy,  but I'm sure he'll agree.
Dear Uncle Dickie,
Mommy told me that she had chosen  Eton College for me for senior school.
I must say, I was very relieved  and now find myself very excited.
Being at Eton makes so much sense.
Am I right in thinking  that you went there, too?
I was never at Eton.
I was tormented  by a particularly dull tutor at home.
Then I was sent to the Naval College  in Osborne.
So, I'm very envious of Eton.
What great fun you'll have there.
And may I suggest a gentleman's outing  to meet Arthur Cunningham,
head cutter of the finest House  in Savile Row?
- Sir.  - Is that a two in the hand?
- Yes, sir.  - Also known as?
- The Eton knot.  - The Eton knot.
And shoot the cuffs.
I think slightly higher on the shoulder.
Yes, sir. Quarter of an inch.
And we position the hat with the thumbs.
The Eton suit.
- Next size up?  - Five, sir.
Five?
- Five.  - Five.
Whites.
Breathe in.
Thank you.
- Now, doesn't that lift the spirits?  - Yes, it does!
Finishing touch.
Oh, yes!
Congratulations, sir!
- Well done, you!  - Thank you!
We won by half a length, which is  the nautical equivalent of a nose.
- Ah. Neck! You've burnt your forehead.  - You should see my legs.
Oh, thank you.
We left it rather late admittedly.  But came good at the last marker.
Which is the nautical equivalent  of the final furlock.
After dinner you should look in  on Charles.
To show him the trophy? Good idea.
No. I thought to compliment him  on his uniforms.
- What uniforms?   - His uniforms for Eton.
What are you talking about?  Charles is going to Gordonstoun.
- Not necessarily.   - Yes, necessarily.
- It's not set in stone.  - Give me a hammer and chisel
and watch me carve it into one.
- Philip.  - Gordonstoun is the right place for him.
It's no exaggeration to say that school  made me, and it can make Charles.
He won't learn a thing  about himself at Eton.
Yes, but he might just survive  or flourish.
Or he might just become  another wet, nambypamby,
mollycoddled twit like the rest  of the British upper classes.
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness.
Dickie thinks  it's the right school for him.
- It's none of Dickie's business.  - He's got a soft spot for Charles.
- They write to one another.  - Since when?
- He heard how unhappy Charles was.  - I wish he'd stop meddling.
Well, meddling is what Dickie does.
We would be betraying our son  if we let Eton have him.
He's going to Gordonstoun,  and that's the end of it.
All right, fine,  if you feel that strongly about it.
- I do.  - We'll return the uniforms.
- You can burn them for all I care.  - But you can break it to Charles, not me.
- Fine.  - Your Majesty.
Thank you, James.
I do like Scotland,  but isn't it a long way from home?
- No. - And a terrible inconvenience
- for you to come and visit me there? - No. Not at all.
I've already decided to fly you  up there myself as a special treat.
But...
I won't lie to you.
When I heard I was going to Gordonstoun,  I felt exactly as you do now.
Wretched.
I wanted to stay at home  with my dear, favorite sister.
I wanted the easier, softer way.
But in order to grow up properly,
you need to get away  from all this nonsense.
Would you like me to let you into  a big secret?
Please.
This... is not the real world.
John. Get rid of those.
You can have my old jumper.  The uniform hasn't changed a bit.
Pop your head through.
That's the first lesson.
Who we are is not what we wear  or what glitters.
It's the spirit that defines us.
In here.
Philip?
Philip?
You're not really going to  fly him to school
dressed for a funeral?
Of course.
One might as well be dressed  for the inevitable.
If we land safely, I'll change.
She's your sister!
See you soon.
Uh, yes, I'm Greek.
Come along.  Let's get this over with.
Ja.
Why did we do this? I hate flying.  We should have gone by train.
Give me your hand.
It's fine. Look at me.
- It's all right. It's just air.  - Yes.
- It's beautiful. - It's freezing!
Why couldn't I have stayed in Germany...
and gone to school there?
Because Father thought it very important  that you be educated by a genius.
And since Dr. Hahn is a Jew,  staying in Germany was impossible.
Fine.
But why did the genius choose Scotland?
Your Royal Highness.
Some foreigner.
- What's your name? - Philip.
Philip what?
Hey. Back to work.
Your Royal Highness!
The big day began  at London Airport,
with the decision to fly him to school.
This is the really modern way  to go to school.
By airplane, piloted by your father,
on this most important day  for our future king.
Welcome!  My dear Dr. Hahn.
- Welcome home, sir. - It's good to be back.
Mr. Tennant,  the head of Charles's year.
Pleasure.
- Good morning, boys! - Good morning, sir.
- Your Royal Highness welcome. - Thank you.
You know this school runs  in your father's blood.
He was one of the first pupils here.
- He helped build the place. - I did, I built that wall.
Yes. Things have changed  a little since your father's time.
But not the important things.
The principles remain unchanged.
- Yeah, good. You haven't gone soft. - No.
Don't want him molly coddled  in some luxury hotel.
This way, Prince Charles!
Are you ready for how tough it is?
How do you feel being far away, sir?
All right. Good. Thank you.
Is this good for him, sir?
Is this the right school for him?
This was your father's dormitory.  We've even given you his old bed.
- Hello, boys. - Morning, sir.
Simon Harper, sir,  dormitory guardian.
Simon will teach you the rules and look after you.
We've given you the window,  Your Royal Highness.
No, no. Don't call him that.  It's just Charles.
Yes, sir. Charles.
Thank you. That's awfully kind.
This is Geddes.
Charles.
Memories flooding back, sir?
Yes.
Happy ones, I hope.
This is Griffiths.
The happiest. Who's that?
The royal detective.
The palace insisted.  In case of press intrusion.
The whole point is the boy learns to fend for himself.
Don't worry.  We know what's expected of us.
The Duke wasted no time  before signing Prince Charles up
to Gordonstoun's  infamous Annual Challenge,
notorious for testing endurance  and determination
in the inhospitable Scottish Highlands.
At Gordonstoun, fitness is valued  just as highly as academic excellence.
The prince is sure to be put through his paces
by their grueling physical regime.
This is surely the place to make our young prince
into a man ready to serve his country.
- It doesn't close. - The thing's broken.
- The rain's getting in. - The frame's broken, idiot.
- Now what are you doing? - Moving the bed.
- Put it back! - But the sheets are getting wet.
Put it back or I'll put you on report.
Lights out!
Come on, we're going to be late.
Faster!
Come on, lads.
Push out.  Hurry up! Let's get it over with!
Out of my way.  Let's go!
Hurry up!
Get up! Your Royal Highness.
Move.
What's wrong?
It's freezing.
Wait until you've had  your cold shower! Come on!
One more lap. Come on!
Right. Come on then!
Come on.
Hey! Get down here!
This isn't optional.  It's your assigned work project.
It's manual labor.
If Hahn wants this place rebuilt,  he ought to pay the staff to do it.
Staff...
- Do you think you're better than us? - Actually, I know I am.
Keep a lookout. Oi. This will be good.
Some mongrel European count?
It's prince, actually.
We know all about your lot.
Your sisters are all Nazis.
And your father's washed his hands of you  so he can be with his whore in Paris.
Uh... It's Monaco.
Your mother's a mental defective,  locked away in some asylum.
You're no one,  and you're going to do the work.
Why? Because I bloody well say so.
Get off!
Get off!
Here!
Sit yourself down.
Jim threw the first punch.
I understand injustice.
We're both exiles.
Both victims and I understand your anger.
But on its current path,
the world will fill with anger  and soon will be destroyed.
So here, away from the madness,  we must build a new way.
A new school. A new philosophy.  A new ethos.
The world needs saviors.
A generation of remarkable young men
who have put fury behind them,
who embrace their pain and their struggle.
All men must step into the unknown.
There, only there, in the annihilation of hate and anger,
and ego, is our salvation.
I can't stay here. They're all mad.  Completely mad.
Cousin Louis' wedding falls  in your halfterm.
Don wants to fly.
I'll tell him I won't go and you can come  and stay with me, in Germany.
- Just the two of us?  - Probably.
What does that mean?
I didn't tell you. I'm expecting.
Expecting what?
- A little one. - Aagain?
Don't be like that.  Castles need to be filled.
And Herr Hitler is encouraging us to have
as many children as we can.
As Germany grows,  she will need more soldiers.
Hello?
Hello?
Idiot!
I thought  I would come up here
and see how you were settling in.
Have you made friends?
One. I think.
Although, it's quite hard to understand  what he says sometimes.
Yes, I hear they've  let some local boys in.
Charles.
Even though I am close to your father,  I am not your father.
Things you feel you cannot show him  or tell him
because you feel they might upset him...
Yes, sir.  Or even disappoint him...
Those are the things you can say to me,
safe in the knowledge that they will  never be repeated to anyone else.
Anyone else on earth.
Yes, sir.
Charles, if you're not happy here,  you must tell me
and I will take care of it.
Dumbo!
What are you doing in here?  Why aren't you dressed for dinner?
-I need to talk to you. -What about?
Could you close the door?
I've made the decision to take Charles out  of Gordonstoun and bring him home.
Decide what you like. He's staying there.
Dickie's just reported  his unhappiness to me.
Dickie's a meddling, interfering fool  who knows nothing.
Well, he knows an unhappy child  when he sees one.
And by all accounts, Charles is wretched.
He's tormented from the moment  that he wakes up
to the moment that he goes to sleep.
Do you know what he calls the place?  "Hell on earth, Colditz with kilts."
I don't want to debate this.  Well, you have to.
And not just because he's your son.  Because he's the future king.
Bullied children are scarred for life.
And scarred children  make destroyed adults.
You and I had an agreement.
A deal that ensured there would be
some level of equality between us  in the marriage.
It's my decision Charles go  to Gordonstoun not now!
And that would be fine,  for all our other children.
But Charles is the future of the Crown.
And in the name of the Crown  and as his mother,
I have decided to take him out  of Gordonstoun and bring him home,
to Eton, to Windsor, where he belongs.
You can't always fall back on the Crown.
Oh, yes, I can. And I will.
Then you would do well to remember  the promises you made to me.
And the consequence breaking those  might have on the Crown.
Charles's education...
is my responsibility.
Yours is to honor your word...
and keep your husband.
-Charles. -Hello, sir.
Are you preparing  for the Annual Challenge?
I am.
The Duke of Edinburgh  is giving the prize this year.
I know.
He's spoken to me a great deal about  the significance of the Challenge.
The Challenge is one of this school's  great traditions, but it is arduous.
You don't think I'm up to it.
Physical endurance is only one path  to selfdetermination.
You have your own particular challenge  here at this school given who you are.
Your father struggled, too.
He had difficulties of a different kind.  Great difficulties, great pain.
But he never gave up, and then,  with help, he prevailed.
I think I would still like  to do the Challenge, sir.
I think my father expects it.
Move!
Come on, boys! Let's go!   Give me a hand up!
Come on!  Go on!
Pull up!  Almost there.
Come on. Help me up!
Get up here!
Did you think I was  going to let it go?
Philip!
Serves him right!
I don't expect you  to get on with everyone.
What I do expect of all my pupils  is to conform with Platonic ideals
to argue without quarreling,  to quarrel without suspecting,
to suspect without slandering.  Sir
You and James will have  extra building duties.
You can work on the main gate together.  Look, in my defense
I think we've all seen how you act  in your defense.
Thank you.
...and as a punishment we have  to build a gate together over halfterm,
instead of coming to see you.  Dr. Hahn telephoned me yesterday.
He's going to keep you  at school over the holidays,
to help you settle. I'm afraid I agreed.
Are you going to be long?  Piss off! You did what?
Which leaves me obliged  to fly to the wedding.
But that's in London.
Yes. We're at the airfield now.
Sorry, but I've got to go.
Now you just settle and behave well.  That'll cheer me up.
Prick!
Philip!
Philip!
Hahn wants you!
Hurry up!
After takeoff from Cologne,
bad weather meant  they couldn't land at Brussels.
While attempting to land in Ostend...
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid all 12 souls were lost.
Twelve.
Including the four crew.
But with four crew, plus Cecile,  Don, Ludwig and Alexander, that's eight.
Also the Grand Duke's mother,
a nurse, Joachim Freiherr von Riedesel.
Eleven.
And your sister Cecile must have gone  into labor
on the flight.
A newborn was found in the wreckage.
Arrangements...
Where is he?
Philip, where are you?
Philip!
Philip!
Philip! Come on!
Philip!  Philip!
Philip!
Philip!  Philip!
He's in the lake!
Come on!
Sir!
Go home!
Back to the school!
Give me the lantern.
You too.
he milk train will leave Inverness station
at 4:45 tomorrow morning.
You will be on it.
From London, you will fly to Berlin  and then on to Darmstadt with your uncle,
to attend the funeral  of your brotherinlaw,
your nephews and your sister.
It will not be easy.
But when you return,  we  will be your family.
This school will be your home.
Now come!
Be strong!
Philip!
Philip.
Philip.
Go on.
Go on.
Philip, come.
Mama. It's Philip.
Your son.
I'm surprised  he dare show himself here.
Papa!
Had it not been for Philip  and his indiscipline...
she would never have taken that flight.
It's true.
Isn't it, boy?
You're the reason we're all here  burying my favorite child.
Get him out of here.
You may hate him now,
but one day, God willing,  you will be a father yourself.
And you will fall short,  as all parents do.
And be hated.
And you will know what it is to pray  for the forgiveness from your own son.
Philip.  Where are you going?
Get inside.
I think he needs help, sir.
Not until he's asked for it. Come.
Move on!
He's here.
Help.
Speak up.
I I need help.
So...
Now we go.
Boys.
Come on, boys.
Three, two...  Hands on.
One.  Lift up!
Steady.  Careful.
Stop. Pull back. Back.
Yeah.  Yeah.
Good. Well done, boys.
You too, Philip.
The challenge ahead is one  that faces every Gordonstounian.
Your route is 18miles long.
Torch.
You are Gordonstounians,
and you are expected  to rise to the challenge.
Plus est en vous , gentlemen.  There is more in each of you.
Plus est en vous.
Hurry up!
Go on!   What?
Go on!
Get a move on, Charlie! Hurry up!
Catch them up! Quick! Go on!
Hurry up!  Hurry up!
Just leave it. Keep going.
Hello, sir!  It's good to have you back!
It's my absolute pleasure.
How's he doing?
Well... they should all be back  at two o'clock.
Sorry, sir.
Never mind.  And Pickering. Griffiths.
Is Charles here?  Let me have a look.
Where's Charles?  We lost him, quite early on.
Geddes. Right, everyone,  get changed quick as you can!
Thank you.
Mr. Peacock, the head of our studies.
How do you do? Good to see you.
And finally, Team B.
Well, I think we should start  the presentation.
Ten more minutes.
Of course.
Charles?
Charles?
Charles?
Right! That's it. Let's begin.
Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you very much!
Well, it's a great joy to be here
and a great pleasure to see  so many happy, healthy, handsome faces.
The Annual Challenge is a unique test.
In completing it, all participants will  have shown great character, stamina,
and most of all...
It's him. Where's he been?
...and most of all, courage.
The ethos at Gordonstoun
is to embrace the community  over the individual,
the team over the star.
And so it gives me great pleasure  to present this wonderful trophy,
the Duke of Edinburgh Cup,  to the winning team,
which I believe is Team C.
Led by Simon Harper.
Well, don't just sit there, boy!  Come and collect it!
Congratulations. Good work.
Well done! Good lad! Well done!
I want you to know, if you're feeling bad
about where you finished  in that challenge today...
it's of no consequence to me.
I understand that these sorts of physical  tests don't come naturally to you.
But you showed great courage
and determination.
Don't worry about it.
Whatever shame you may or may not  be feeling, I can assure you
it's nothing compared to the shame I felt  at your age,
over something I did.
To my favorite sister.  Oh!
Cecile. She hated flying.
Loathed it, terrified of it.
She always dressed in black  when she flew, for her own funeral.
Anyway, the point is that Kurt Hahn  and that school put me back together,
toughened me up. Charles...
The pain...
The struggle is a gift, Charles.
This is the moment you have to dig deep.
You put the work in now  and you won't struggle in the future.
But you've got to toughen up a little,  boy, for what is ahead of you.
Don't worry about it! It's just air!
I know there's more in you, Charles.
You've got to be strong,  and you've got to find it.
It's just air!
Get him back here!  Don't be so weak!
Don't be so bloody weak!
Charles, it's all right.
Charles!
It's all right.
Winds are picking up...
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Darling Anne!  How's my favorite little girl?
Faster, Daddy!  I'm coming, I'm coming!
Thank you.
You must be hungry.  Like me to make you a sandwich?
Yes, please. Hello, Martin!
