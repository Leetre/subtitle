Miles?- 那真是太赞了  - 是吧- That was amazing! - I know.我觉得一群蜘蛛应该叫做一团I thought a group of spiders was called a "clutter."不  我是说  你做得太赞了No. I mean, what you did was amazing.再加上你有可能想出来了打败克莱文的办法Plus you might've just figured a way to beat Kraven.是吗I did?是的  他研究了我的模式  但是你对于Yes. He's studied my patterns, but you're so new这一套超级英雄的事物还很陌生  你还没有任何模式to this whole superhero thing, you don't even have patterns yet.所以不懂套路还是件好事So me being inexperienced is a good thing?现在是好事Right now it is.如果我们想要打败克莱文我们就需要不可预测So we both need to be unpredictable if we're going to beat Kraven.什么地方我们绝对不会去  喜剧俱乐部Where's someplace we never go?

Ugh!除非那是个喜剧俱乐部的名字Unless that's the name of the comedy club.跟我来Follow me!不Nope.在这里没什么有意思的Nothing funny about being down here.克莱文绝对不会在地下设陷阱There's no way Kraven set any traps below ground,因为我从来没有用过下水道because I never use the sewers.太妙了Brilliant.除非  除非什么Unless... Unless what?在节目上  克莱文同样试图预测On the show, Kraven also tries to predict他的目标的后备计划what backup plan his target might use.像是  比如说  躲到地下Like, say, going underground?喔  蜘蛛感应来了Whoa!
