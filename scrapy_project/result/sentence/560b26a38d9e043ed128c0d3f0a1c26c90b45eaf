-Ship oars! -Hold back!
Get ready!
And another!
Our King is returned!
Welcome back, my King!
This is your kingdom?
No. My kingdom is far greater.
My kingdom reaches to the far ends of this land.
My kingdom is in here.
I don't like the look of it.
And yet it's your new home!
Our warriors went to England and exacted revenge
for the death of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our Great Army was victorious everywhere!
Some of the leaders of the army
decided to remain in England.
Some wanted to pursue other dreams, like my brother.
But don't worry.
Halfdan went exploring with Bjorn Ironside,
so what harm can come to him?
You know where my heart lies.
It lies here, with you.
You know I want to make this town
the capital of Norway.
It has always been my dream!
This woman is Astrid.
She is part of my dream.
Sit.
Get used to it.
Ya!
Slave. Do you know who I am?
Of course.
You are Ivar.
Ivar?
Is that it?
No. Ivar the Boneless.
You don't seem afraid of me.
No.
We are expecting to be attacked by the Saxons.
They have a large army outside of these walls.
We must ask the gods for help.
We must offer them a sacrifice.
Would you be willing to offer yourself as a sacrifice?
I will do anything you ask me to do.
Then take off your clothes.
Come closer.
Kiss me.
I... I don't understand.
I know you're a cripple, Boneless.
But let me tell you something.
Your deformity means that the gods favor you especially.
I've always known that.
I always look for people who are born different.
Because that's the true sign.
You are a very special person.
Nobody else here is like you.
You are destined for great things.
You are free to go.
-Do you not want me to... -No.
No, you don't understand.
You are a free woman now.
Leave.
Move the torches over there!
Keep those barrages burning on the perimeter!
Your Highness. Your Grace.
What news?
The Northmen have not secured the Roman walls of the town.
They remain undefended.
That's where we enter.
Yes.
Tomorrow we attack York.
And may God be with us.
Why did you really decide to come with me?
Why did you go into the wilderness?
You had something to prove.
So do I.
What do you want to achieve?
My brother loves fame more than I do.
For me,
I just want to live.
But I want to live with the greatest intensity.
I want to feel every moment of my life,
as long as it lasts.
I want to be more than just alive,
if you understand me.
Oh, I do.
Sindric.
What keeps you awake?
I have been thinking.
Where we are going,
it will be much better to appear as traders
rather than raiders.
So?
So, you should send most of your fleet home.
Better to proceed with, at most, three of your ships.
But I will feel naked.
Better naked than dead.
Men at arms!
Face forward!
Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
Let me now be ashamed.
Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
Let them be ashamed,
which transgressed with our cause.
Show me thy way O, Lord.
Teach me Thy path.
For Thou art the God of my salvation,
on Thee do I wait all the day.
- Amen. - Amen.
My boys, you have a care for each other.
And you do your duty.
I am sure we shall.
Come, brother.
Mount up! Prepare to march!
Prepare to march!
- That's him. -Who?
Aethelwulf, King Ecbert's son.
Oh, and he brought his own sons.
Like lambs to the slaughter.
Hvitserk, let's go.
My King!
We divide our forces.
We meet at the cathedral.
And may God be with us.
Follow me.
With me!
Get out! Get out! Move! Move!
Alfred! Back!
This way!
Where's another way?
Here!
There's no other way! We must do this!
Alfred!
Go!
Lord, forgive the work I must do this day.
Come out and fight, you coward!
Alfred!
Father!
Go!
Where's your brother? Where's your brother?
Wait!
Charge!
Aethelred!
Son!
Fight for your King!
Fight for your God!
Come on, boy! Move!
Oh, clap your hands, all ye people.
Shout unto God with the voice of triumph!
For the Lord most high
is terrible.
God reigneth over the heathen!
Retreat! Retreat!
Retreat! Retreat!
We did well, brothers.
- We? - Yes.
I saved your life.
It was all my strategy.
- And you know that.  - We all did very well, though.
Why... Why do you argue, huh?
- I'm not arguing. - Good.
The most important thing is what we do next.
And isn't that obvious, Ubbe?
Yes.
We have defeated the Saxons.
Let's make good our claim to the land.
Let's all make peace.
I have no interest in peace.
"Peace" is a dirty word.
More of our people
can cross the water.
We can all farm, huh?
Now, it is time to negotiate.
And that is the wrong advice, as always, Ubbe.
So, Ivar,
what do you suggest, hmm?
The Saxons lost the battle,
but they have not yet lost the war.
I would
beware of trying to negotiate with them.
You.
Where is she?
Why hasn't she come?
She refuses.
Skol!
Skol!
Serve the food!
Everyone is starving! Eat!
Skol!
Hvitserk! Hvitserk!
Not a word! We're leaving!
And that's when I killed the whale.
Forgive me, King Harald.
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
But...
Thank you
for the feast.
Move.
You look very beautiful.
Very beautiful.
What am I supposed to say?
I have no luck with women.
Skol!
Skol! -Drink!
What do you think?
They said they would give us their decision
first thing in the morning.
Do not worry.
Hvitserk!
This is the right thing to do.
Welcome back, brothers.
Oh, you look thirsty!
Are you thirsty?
I know you shouldn't say, "I told you so."
But I told you so.
-Ivar, we went... -No, no, no. Let me guess.
You went to the Saxons and tried to make a deal.
They spoke sweet words to you.
They want to make peace?
Claim the land that my father gave them.
Ubbe and Hvitserk,
two sons of Ragnar Lothbrok,
are offering to lay down their arms.
They are very brave warriors. I saw that today.
We must consider their offer.
My father had no right
to grant them that land.
He was no longer King.
But now you are King,
and you can offer it.
As a man of God,
do you not advocate peace and mercy?
Yes,
of course,
my Prince.
Good.
But of course you were brave.
You fought back.
You fought back, right?
You didn't let them get away with that.
Huh?
-I was just trying... -You made a bad call!
You showed yourself to be weak.
You two are lucky to be alive.
And now it is finally time
for you to recognize me
as the rightful leader of the Great Army.
As your older brother...
As your older brother,
I will never, ever accept that.
In any case, it would be a dereliction of duty...
And, after all,
doesn't somebody have to be responsible
for the care of our people?
Hmm, it doesn't seem to me
that you have taken that good care of them so far.
You cannot...
Ivar.
Ivar.
Ivar!
You cannot continue to fight in England
without Hvitserk and me.
I think
that you will find that more of our warriors
and shield-maidens want to fight with me
than go farm with you two.
Right? Right?
Then Hvitserk and I will go back
to Kattegat tomorrow with our forces.
If that is your decision.
Our father...
Our father would have hated you
for sundering and splitting his family.
I don't think so.
Look at you!
Trying to sneak away to avoid your shame!
Surely you must be embarrassed that nobody else is with you!
Now, why is that?
I can't understand it, can you?
Ubbe,
nobody is with you!
Everyone is with me!
Let's go.
Hvitserk.
You see? Everyone is with me.
