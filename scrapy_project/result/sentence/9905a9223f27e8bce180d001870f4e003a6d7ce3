country,killed 3 innocent people,true patriots.Today, we must return their bodiesto the earth.This tragic eventhas disturbed all of Georgia.And this is at a time when our republicis rapidly developingand the name of the Georgian peoplerings with pride.A time when our achievementshave been multipliedand we have tasted thefruits of our labor,it is at this momentthat we received a traitor's blow.What did they want?They had everything.What did they have?Did they lack something?Don't talk to me like the announcer on TVwho is reading a script.Stop the car.Get out.What is this drivel?!That's it's hell hereand heaven there.How do you knowhow life is everywhere?Here, everything is beautiful,and there, everything is different.It's a shamethat they didn't get out.In exactly 2 monthsthey would be begging their parentsto bring them back.How do you knowhow life is over there?You're right,I don't know.Because I haven’t seen anythingand I don't want you to tell me about it.I don't want to haveone of these dissident conversations.What’s wrong with you?Is your conscience gnawing at you?They're all my children.My body and blood.But they’ll answerfor their actions.We're done here.In the name of the students and the YoungCommunist League of the Academy of Arts,we denounce the heinous actof our ex-classmates.Our youth student organizationfully supports the opinionof the university board.The hijackers must be punishedas severely as possible.They’re not worthy of being citizensof our great Soviet motherland.Shame on them.Comrades,what did they lack?Their families had everything.Everything.Their parents should be jailedtogether with them.- Did something happen?- Nothing, continue on.- Does Daniil live here?- Yes.What's going on?The suspectsdirected us to you.They claimthat you were their spiritual leader.Did they gatherat your place?I don't know.Did you take them to church?That's how I live.Yeah, your professionis quite unusual.Do you recognize this?We confiscated itfrom one of the hijackers,he claimsthat you gave it to him.Yes, it's mine.So you used thisto cloud the minds of children?With what?Music and the Gospel?According to the laws of our country, thisis propaganda of the bourgeois life-style.You should have known that.Are you tryingto play stupid?We’ll jail youwith the rest of your friends.I wasn’ton the plane.Sit down.How can you atone for your actions?What can you say to the familiesof the murdered?You had everything!What were you missing?Do you still want to go to the West?Still think the West is superiorto our Soviet system?How could you betray such valuesas friendship and humanity?!This is Gospel that you read,Doesn't it include the 10 commandments?Doesn't it say 'Thou shalt not kill'?In your closing words saythat you are guilty.I already said that.Yes, but clearer.But you told me thatif I take the blame on myself,that they wouldget a reduced sentence?Yes, of course, that makes sense.You weren’t on the plane at all.They won’t punish you.Alright, thank you.Your honor, I have providedevidence of guiltof the defendants:Chheidze, Lasha and Irakli Barbakadze,Koberidze and Maisuradze.Now, I urge you to considerthe severity of their crime.Their actions led to deathsof innocent passengersand members of the flight crew.The last word is givento Daniil Cheidze.They had nothing to dowith it.It was all me,I set them to it.Cheidze, don’t take so much on yourself,you don't need to say that much.Yes,but I spoke to them.The investigation has already determinedwhat you said to them.Do you understand?Sit down.Anna Maisuradze.You may speak.No amount of freedomis worth the life of another.I'm sorry,I don't know what to say.Alright.Nikoloz Koberidze.It's really hard for meto speak.I don't know,I won’t be able to apologize.What would that look like?It would be insultingto the victims.The court rules to sentence.Anna Maisuradze to15 years of incarceration.Daniil Chheidzeis sentenced to death.But you promised,you lied to me.Irakli and Lasha Barbakadze,sentenced to death.Nikolas Koberidze: Sentenced to death.They must have been buriedhere.I think this iswhere they buried the executed.- Aren’t you cold, don’t you have a hat?- No.So many years have passed.Can we even identify the bodies?It's terrible.They could have at least shown the parentstheir graves.- Wait in the car.- What?Wait in the car.- And you?- I'll come.Don't,don’t go there.- Is it Nika?- No, it's not Nika.Who is it then,where is my son?I saved your things, you know.Here they’re.Your jacket.You knowwhat I always think about?The day before, at the wedding,you were so happy.What happened, Anna?Did he tell you?Was he resentful at meabout something?Not at all!He said that if we had left,we would have brought you with us.How stupid.Who would have let you out of the country?Why did you drag your girlfriendinto it?And who did he leave me with?He was my only son.Stupid boy.I know how scared he must have beenin the plane.And those poor passengers?Where were you going?How could you have decided on that?We always heard stories abouthow horrible the countrywas that you lived in; abouthow unhappy you were.I don't know what you heard,but nobody wanted to leave like that.We didn't want to leave like thateither.Please make your way.Please take your seat.Dear passengers, please buckle up.- Are you afraid of flying?
