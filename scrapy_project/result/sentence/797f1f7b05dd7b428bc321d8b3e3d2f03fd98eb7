They are heathens.那我们必须撤退Well, then, we must retreat.回到韦塞克斯Return to Wessex.重建军队  现在暂时让它落入约克手中Raise another army and leave them, for now, in possession of York.我不同意I disagree.- 我们没有选择  - 恰恰相反- We have no choice. - On the contrary.我不懂I don't understand.我看到过幻像I had a vision.我看到两位先知I saw the two witnesses who are the prophets大地之神的见证人standing before the God of the earth.如果有人想伤害他们And if any man should harm them,他们的嘴中就会喷火  吞噬敌人fire would proceed from their mouths and devour their enemies.如果有人想伤害他们  必须死And if any man should harm them, he must be killed.你说话真难懂  黑蒙德主教You speak in riddles, Bishop Heahmund.我看到的是真的What I saw was real.我看到了恶人的尸体I saw all the dead bodies of the wicked躺在伟大城市的街道上lying in the street of the great city,因为可以埋葬他们的人都不在了for there was no one left to bury them.我看到的伟大城市是约克And I saw that this great city was York,这些死人都是北方异教徒and all those dead bodies were of pagan Northmen.他们是饿死的They died because they starved.因为没有食物They died because they had nothing to eat没有水and nothing to drink被困在了伟大的城市中and were walled up in a great city.我们应该那样做吗Is that what we should do?是的Yes.把约克所有通路堵上Close all roads to York.阻挡所有河流Blockade all rivers.阻止北方人进出Prevent the Northmen from coming and going.这样  困住他们And in that way, trap them,饿死他们starve them,逼迫他们投降force them to surrender.当他们意识到我们的计划And when they realize our plan,他们可能会奋起袭击they might emerge and attack us而我们的军队所剩无几了while our forces are much depleted.你觉得呢  父亲What do you say, Father?我说I say,你去命令指挥官关闭一切通往约克的you go and order our commanders to close the roads, the rivers,道路  河流  通道passageways that lead to York.我们把他们饿死We will starve them out.在神的保佑下With God's help.他会帮助我们的  埃塞尔沃夫国王Oh, He will help us, King Aethelwulf.请放心Be assured of it.乌伯Ubbe!乌伯Ubbe!乌伯Ubbe!非常欢迎来到我们的炉边  乌伯You're more than ever welcome back to our hearth, Ubbe.我们都听说了伟大军队的成功We have all heard of the successes of our great army,你是怎么为拉格纳复仇how you revenged Ragnar's death,打败埃勒王和艾克伯特的overcame both Aelle and Ecbert.我很感谢自己的儿子I thank my own son,同样还有所有拉格纳的儿子们but also you and all the sons of Ragnar成就了这番不朽的事业for these immortal events.那你肯定听说了西格德死在伊瓦尔手上的事Then you must have heard of Sigurd's death at the hands of Ivar.还有他对比约恩的挑战  他成为了大军统帅And his challenge to Bjorn that he was the leader of the great army.我想告诉你们俩I want to tell you both...比约恩·艾恩赛德自始至终都表现出了伟大的荣耀和勇气Bjorn Ironside behaved himself throughout with great honor and courage.我敬爱他  如同兄长一般I love and admire him as a brother.谢谢你这么说比约恩Thank you for your words about Bjorn.他是个好人  我知道He is a good man.
