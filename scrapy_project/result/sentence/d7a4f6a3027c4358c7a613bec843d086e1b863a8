* I adore being dressed  in something frilly *
* When my date comes to get me at my place *
* Out I go with my Joe  or John or Billy *
* Like a filly who is ready  at the race *
* When I have  a brand new hairdo *
* With my eyelashes  all in curls *
* I float as the clouds  on air do *
* I enjoy being a girl *
* When men say I'm cute...*
Good morning, ladies.
Eighth floor, please.
Third floor, please.  Fifth for me.
Thank you, ladies.
You make it look easy.  Ma'am?
Operating the elevator,  like it's second nature.
Yes, ma'am.
Although I'm sure it's way more complicated than it looks,
a testament to your skill.
Third floor.
* I drool over dresses  made of lace *
* I talk on the telephone... *
Good job.
So, how do you like working  for B. Altman?
Well, I've been here  for 16 years.
A ringing endorsement.
How many times a day do you  think that you open this...
Fifth floor.
Ooh, that's me.
Smooth as silk.
Thank you, Darren.
Love the outfit.
* Who'll enjoy being a guy *
* Having a girl
* Like...*
Good to see you again,  Frank. Take care.
Mrs. Maisel.
Beautiful printing.
I've got a pretty mean cursive, too.
Brearley and Bryn Mawr,  I have no doubt.
So, you're prepping  for Christmas?
The display department  always likes to get a nice jump.
Never too early  to scout for Santas.
Lots of jolly choices out there.
Oh, we screen them  fresh every year.
Make sure they're still plump,  still personable, still sober.
So much to think about.
So, you majored  in Russian Literature.
With a minor in Education.  For a split second,
I thought about being  a grammar school teacher.
What happened?  I met some grammar school kids.
No, seriously, I married  straight out of college
and had children of my own.  Two, actually.
Started my own grammar school,  if you will.
And you're here for our  elevator operator position?
Yes, sir.
We usually hire men  for that job.
Oh. The ad didn't say.
I just think that our lady shoppers
prefer men in the position.  I get that.
Not a lot of practical work experience
on your rÃ©sumÃ©, either.
But lots of volunteer work.
It's all listed there.  I was a candy striper.
And in high school,  I helped raise money
to start a gymnastics program,  the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem.
Raised $700.  Impressive.
Lots of little Jews tumbling around because of me.
Mrs. Maisel, you are  a very delightful woman,
but I'm not sure that being  an elevator operator
is the right fit for you.  I'm sorry.
Oh, but I have such  a passion for it.
I grew up with one in my building,
my sweet Jerry,
So, in a way,  I feel as if my whole life
has been leading up to this.  Your whole life?
And I really hit it off  with Darren on the way up.
Lots of informative shoptalk.
Darren is very personable.
And the uniform.  Picture me in that hat
and the coat with a tapered  waist. I mean, come on.
Thank you for coming in.
Les Tarlow.
Come on in.
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!
I just go through periods where nothing looks good.
Well, that's not true  and you know it.
I guess I can  just stick with red.
Can't go too wrong there.
Well, you could try a dark pink lipstick, too.
That might work better with the pink you picked for your rouge.
Oh, please. I just worked up the courage to wear red
in a vain attempt to look like Leslie Caron in Gigi.
Oh.  Red works great with pink.
Pardon me?
And it's terrific  with your complexion.
You have some natural rosiness.  Just be sure to pick a tone
that doesn't augment  that too much.
Keep it subtle.
I like subtle.
That's Raven Red.
Try Cherries in the Snow.
That'll get you close to Caron.
Oh, I like that.
A lot.  I do, too.
You're a dream. Both of you.
Thank you.  Give me three of these.
I'll meet you down at the register, Mrs. Stapleton.
Wonderful.
Wow. What is your name?
Midge Maisel.
Mary Petrusca.
You should get my commission.
No.  Really.
How about the makeup counter?
Good morning, Mr. Weissman.  Good morning, Zelda.
Listen, I have a faculty meeting  this morning,
and Zed Lieberman  will drone on and on again,
repetitiously, unendingly.
Do you understand?  Zed Lieberman is boring.
So I need a copious amount  of coffee to keep me awake.
In a thermos?  A thermos? No, not a thermos.
Zelda, right now,  just a big, strong cup.
Yes, Mr. Weissman.
Morning, Mama.  Morning, Papa.
Aha.  Mwah. Morning, Zelda.
Good morning, Miss Miriam.  Would you like some coffee?
I'll just grab some  on the street.
Can you watch the kids today?  I'm home by 5:00.
Of course. Where are you  off to in such a rush?
I'm going to work.
What?
I got a job.
Why?
I need money. My own money,  with no strings.
Strings? Parttime for now,  but I'll have an employee review
in one month, and if they  like my performance,
I will be a fulltime makeup  counter girl at B. Altman.
You got a job?  Yes.
You have no rÃ©sumÃ©.  They hired me anyway.
Do you know how to type?  I don't need to.
Okay.
I told you to study  something practical in college.
I remember that. Russian  literature was not that thing.
I know.
Okay.
And it's five days a week?  Yes.
If it rains, you still have to go in. I figured.
And you know how to get there?  By multiple routes.
Okay.
And they're paying you?  Yes.
In money?  Yes.
By check?  Every two weeks.
You'll need a bank account.  I have a bank account.
Checking and savings?  Yep.
Okay.
Your mother can't watch the kids every day.
Mrs. Fulber will watch them  when she can't.
Okay.
Mrs. Fulber?  Yep.
The one that used to babysit  you? The one and the same.
She's still alive?
I think so.
I'll be damned.
Zelda, I'll need my coffee...  Your thermos, Mr. Weissman.
Thank you.
Okay.
* It isn't enough to hope *
* It isn't enough to dream *
* It isn't enough  to plot and plan and scheme *
* It isn't enough  to stand here *
* Saying that life is grand here *
* Waiting for something...*
Good morning, Jerry.  Good morning, Mrs. Maisel.
* It isn't enough to sit here *
* Having a purple fit here *
* Worried to death  the world will burn up *
Guess where I'm going, Jerry.
* It isn't enough... *
Doctor?
Nope. I'm going to work.
Work?
* I've got a better scheme *
Why not wish upon a wishbone
Pick a fourleaf clover
Rub a rabbit's foot
And throw a horseshoe over
* Your lucky shoulder *
Ladies' break room?
Right in there.
* A bit of luck  will come your way *
* Now, isn't that enough *
* To make *
* Your day? *
Really? You're one of us now?
Makeup department. First day.
Mary, right?
I'm Midge.  I remember.
Grab any empty locker.
- I'm in love. - Who now?
The new guy in men's hosiery.
- What hap... - He looks like William Holden.
What happened to Montgomery Clift in shoes?
- I'm off him. - She just broke up with Ernest Borgnine last week.
I'm done with loading dock guys.
I'm Vivian. This your first day?
Midge. Yes. First day.
Do you like the movies?  I go every night.
I do like the movies.
Be my friend. I need people to go with.
- I'll be your friend. - You bring a lock?
- For what? - Thieves run rampant.
Someone stole my lunch last week.
Just an egg salad sandwich, but I got really mad.
- Then I need to get a lock. - Put your stuff in mine today.
Thanks, Mary.
That's smart.
- We are on our feet all day. - You'll learn.
Doors open in five minutes, girls!
- Mrs. O'Toole. - Our mother hen.
Come on.
Remember, Midge:
always be on time...
always be polite...
always be pretty...
and...
...don't forget to punch.
Fun.
So, there are a couple of jerks to steer clear of.
- Van Heflin in housewares. - She's not gonna know
who they are if you keep using movie star names.
The boys in toys.
Super grabby.
Camera department they'll make you shudder.
- That's funny. - That was my joke.
Tell her that was my joke.
Another compadre, Harriet Owens.
She services our darkcomplexioned clientele.
She is one of us. Midge Maisel.
- Nice to meet you. - Harriet's a model.
- Aspiring. - Neat. Runway?
Not with this skin.
She's been in Ebony magazine
a million times, looking like Lena Horne.
Eight times. And looking to expand.
Doors
are opening!
That's probably what she says before having sex.
- The new girl? - Yes, ma'am.
Learn the store.
Ah, I will. Yes.
Agnes Moorehead.
How did I miss that?
I'll give you a map to learn the store. It's a snap.
My husband loved Agnes Moorehead.
Loved? Dead?  Sad.
No, he left me.  We're separated.
Separated?  Like Liz Taylor!
Sad. And I've got two kids; oldest is almost four.
And you work. Modern. Sad.
You ready to do this?
Good a time as any.
Hi. My name is Miriam.
How can I help you today?
Men's shoes fourth floor, southeast side.
Hifi systems eighth floor...
left of the elevators.
Right. Okay, it's hifi systems right of the elevators.
Cookware fifth floor.
Maternity...
third floor.
My feet hurt.
- Miriam? - Gonna bring flats tomorrow.
Hi, baby.
- That's the key. Flats. - For what?
- For what? For work. - You work?
Yes, Mama, you knew that. I told you this morning.
- Oh, that's right. I'm going out with some friends tonight.
But Mrs. Fulber can take the kids.
- I'll get them when I come home. - That sounds fine.
- Something wrong? - What would be wrong?
I got you something.
You never have to get me anything.
I wanted to get you something.
Oh, it must be around here. Couldn't walk far.
I did, too.
What is that?
It's lipstick.  I thought you'd like it.
- Where did you get it? - My job. At the makeup counter. At work.
Oh, yes, that.
It went well, my first day.
It's a brand new color.
It's not officially released till the end of the week.
So I'm a guinea pig.
No. You're the first woman in New York to have it.
And it's pretty,  and I thought of you.
Yeah, you don't like what I wear now.
No, I like it a lot.
I think it looks nice.
So do I.
This smells funny.
But thank you.
You are very welcome.
*Did you hear what they did at the WPA?*
*When the banks went belly up, and the jobs all went away*
*They reinvested in America*
*They put the poor to work at honest pay*
*They built dams and roads and bridges*
*Things that we still use today*
*Did you hear what they did at the WPA?*
*When speculators drove the market into New York Bay*
*They gave a corps of citizens a place to go*
*With a chance to make some hay...  Hey.
Hi. Nice crowd.
Take a gander.
My business cards.
Got them up to a nice round 30.
- Let me see. - Hey, are your hands clean?
- Yeah. - I don't want smudges.
Yeah. You smudged it.
- Now I got a nice round 29. Thanks. - Sorry.
Well, these are gonna be obsolete soon, anyway.
- Do you want to know why? - Yes. Why?
I'm getting a phone.
Don't lie to me.
No shit, I'm getting a phone.
Welcome to the 20th century.
Yeah. Then, I'll put my phone number on the card.
Mymy typewriter's missing its three, eight, nine,
so I just got to be sure the number doesn't have
- a three, eight or a nine in it. - Seems doable.
It's gonna have an answering service.
And some chatty broad's gonna know all my shit.
It's gonna cost me a fortune, but it'll be worth it.
Uh "Susie Myerson's office."
"Yes, may I speak with Susie Myerson, please?
"ItIt's about some very important,
showrelated business."
"Uh, she's not in at the moment, so go fuck yourself."
You might want to soften that a little.
Yeah, but pretty cool, huh?
"Susie Myerson's office."
"Susie Myerson and Associates."
- What? - Thinking big, right?
Yeah. I'm thinking big.
All right, thank you,  Ethan Carter and his combo!
Well, that was almost palatable.
Now, get your stuff off and  we'll bring on the next act.
Okay. It's gonna be a comedian.
So hang tight, everybody, and get ready to laugh.
You good to go?
Oh, God, yeah.
Started my new job today.
It was crazy.
So many stories. I hung out with these young girls,
cute as buttons.
And the customers, they were hysterical.
Great. You want to run it by me?  A little, uh, practice run?
Oh, no. I don't want to get stale.
So, "Miriam," right?
Yes, but I'll be using a nom de plume.
- A nom de what? - Nom de plume.
- Sounds like a sex toy. - Yeah, like it goes up
your ass or something. It's a fake name.
II don't  want to use my real name.
Fine, then give me your fake name.
Well, now I can't think of one.
Eh, FFanny, I guess.
And the last name?
Brice.
- "Fanny Brice"? - That's taken.
Then Fanny Jones. Uh...
Fanny Jone that is a terrible name.
Yeah, like you put zero thought into it.
Jackie, please, just make up a last name for me.
I'll come up with a permanent one later.
- Okay. - Okay, I repeat:  I like your real name.
I don't want to use my real name.
Hey, your call.
All right, give it up for a very funny lady,
whose name you're gonna want to remember.
Fanny Midge.
Come here.
Thank you, everybody.
That's very nice of you,
seeing as how I haven't done anything yet.
So.
I started work today.
A new job.
And it was crazy.
Super crazy.  I'mI'm a makeup counter girl
at B. Altman.  Who here's been to B. Altman?
No one?
Really? Or isis there one person? I c...
This spotlight is so bright,  I can't see a thing.
Blinding. Eh, co...
Maybe, just...
Well, B. Altman  is a department store.
But I think my favorite thing  I did today
and this is gonna sound weird
was punching in  on the time clar...
"Time Clark."
What is wrong with my mouth?
"Time clock."
Punching in  was just kind of a real
powerful feeling, you know?
You know, thethe feel of it.
The sound of it.
MMy interview for the job  was another thing.
They were already getting ready  for Christmas.
It's not even Halloween yet,  and I'm sitting in a hallway
with a couple of dozen  fat fucking Santas.
Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. Picture that.
Me, and a line of big, fat  fucking Santas, and you know,
some of these guys  are fucking fat, and...
They drink.
They are tipplers.
That's what Mr. Stanyon told me.
"Keep them sober."
Thatthat's actually  not Mr. Stanyon's voice,
that's Mrs. O'Toole.
"Doors are opening."
That's what she says  when she's about to have sex.
Lots of really pretty...
fun girls at work, too.
Uh, Mary, she's sweet.
Vivian, kind of boy crazy,  with her Van Heflins
and William Holdens and...
All right. You win.
Uh, and then, there's Harriet.
She's our Negro clerk.
And beautiful, like, God,  this woman is beautiful.
She'sshe's Lena Horne,  she helps our Negro customers.
Because she's a Negro.
What?
Harriet's a Negro.  Where's this going?
Itit's not going anywhere.
Obviously.
Thisthis spotlight  is really fucking bright.
CCan you dim that?
I mean, really, really,  it's bright as shit.
Okay, well, now the audience  can't see me at all.
Doesn't matter.
Oh. So he's funny.
Him you laugh at. All right.
Okay, justjust getting  the lay of the land here.
You want to come up?
Yeah, didn't think so.
Really? You're notyou're  not gonna turn
the spotlight back on?
Can't find the switch?
My underwear suddenly feels  very tight.
Well.
Uh, thanks, everybody.
It's been delightful.
You still got more time.
Well, give my time  to someone else.
This isn't fucking Congress.  Get back up there.
No. And fix the fucking mic,  it won't come off the stand.
Sorry about that, everyone.
Uh, we're gonna take a little  break to clear the stink.
And we'll be back in 20.
Jesus.
What is wrong with these people?
Absolutely nothing  is wrong with these people.
Nothing? They're unconscious.  They're lying in state.
And who is heckling me?
There was another comic  up there an hour ago.
He killed. Same audience.
No. Uhuh, no way.
You stunk tonight, lady.  That's all it was.
No, Susie, this fucking audience  could hardly lift their heads
- up off the table long enough... - The audience was fine.
You bombed.  You took out Antwerp.
- I bombed? - People were asking
for directions  to a fallout shelter.
You bombed.
- But I'm funny. - Everybody bombs.
But I've seen Rickles  five times. He's never bombed.
The guys go on Jack Paar,  they never bomb.
Yeah, that's 'cause  they've spent years bombing
and honing their act so  you don't have to see them bomb.
They've bombed, believe me.
Well, I'm not gonna bomb again.
No, you're gonna bomb again  and again and again and again.
Why would anyone do this  if they're just gonna bomb
again and again and again?
Because it's part  of the process.
Yeah, well, it's not part  of my process.
Shit.
I've only done this  drunk or stoned.
Whatwhat if that's  the only reason I was funny?
Like, I can't get loaded  every time I come on stage.
You never met a comic?
All right, here.  Go smoke a cigarette.
No, I'm not gonna  go smoke a cigarette.
I feel devastated.
I've never felt this devastated.
You mean, besides  when your husband left you.
- Give me a cigarette. - Next time, prepare a little.
Spontaneity works  until it doesn't work.
Then you're stuck.
Prepare.
All right.
Right.
- Fuck. - So we went to this cabdriver,
and, uh, I don't want you  to think we're like that,
you know, but you must remember  what men are like in war,
it's that kind of a show  tonight.
So we went to this cabdriver,  and we said to him,
"Where's the action?"
This kind of masculine,  sort of...
So, so he took us to this place  where they fish illegally.
See, now you're not supposed...
Be prepared
And be careful not to do  your good deeds
When there's no one  watching you
If you're looking  for adventure
Of a new and different kind
And you come across  a Girl Scout
Who is similarly inclined
Don't be nervous,  don't be flustered
Don't be scared
Be prepared!
That is the most beautiful song  ever written.
Who wrote that song?
Franz fucking Schubert!
- Ah, did he now? - Guys, guys,  you're not in your homes.
Sorry, Sal.
Sally. Sally, Sally.
We were conquerors today.
Conquerors!  Veni, vidi, vici!
- That's Latin. - Is that so?
Sal, Sal, we sold plastic stuff
to people that don't actually  need plastic stuff.
Yeah. Seesee, that's what  salesmanship is, Sally.
Selling things  to people that they don't want.
- It's kind of our calling. - Two more.
Then you go home.
- Sally's. - We're not going home.
- I got to go home. - Then we'll go home.
I think we just wrote  Samuel Beckett's next play.
It's not that hard.
Joel, it's for you.
I love that people know  how to reach you here.
It's so urban.
Hello?
Hey, Pen.
Yeah, a certain young man  did send you some flowers.
Guess he forgot to include  a card.
Good, good, I'm glad.
Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, stay up. - Take out the papers
- All right, bye. - And the trash...
No. No, Sal.
Who put this song on?
- It offends my sensibilities.  I don't pick the music.
Yeah, but you can pull the plug.
This song isn't bad.
Penny likes this song.
Penny's young. Penny will learn.
She's meeting the parents  this week.
Oh! Big stuff.
She's pretty nervous.
She doesn't have anything  to be nervous about.
She's a sweet girl.  Penny's great.
- Yeah? - Yeah. Buddy,  everyone loves Penny.
Yeah.
And she's all excited about  seeing The Music Man next week.
Oh, man, we've been dying  to see that show.
Especially Imogene.
How'd you get tickets?
I got friends in high places.
You're the man.
You know, I scored four seats,
so I don't know, if you and  Imogene want to tag along...?
Are you kidding? Imogene would  cancel surgery to see that show.
Yes, we will go.
You want to know what night?  You may have plans.
Whatever's planned is canceled.
- We're going. - Great!
God, I can't wait to tell her.
And Penny will be excited, too.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a man  with a rose in his lapel.
Isn't that fun?
Excuse me. Herb Smith?
That depends.  Are you with the government?
No.
Then I'm Herb Smith.
I joke.  Ah.
- Midge Maisel, I presume. - You said,
"Find the man with the rose  in his lapel."
And you did.  Welcome to my office.
Mama, look at boo boo, they
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look at boo boo,  they...
Ever been to the Stage Deli?
Many moons ago.
I'm a little more Barney Greengrass.
- You hungry? - I could eat.
Waitress?
Verla, how much  do you love your Herb?
With every bone in my body.
Bring us, uh, a half pastrami on rye
and a half chopped liver on challah,
a stuffed cabbage,
some kasha varnishkes,
- and a bit of arugula. - You got it.
I know what you're thinking.
"He's extremely Jewish."
And extremely hungry.
Guilty on all counts.
So, tell me why you called.
I'm looking to hone an act.
Great. As what?
A standup act.
A comedienne. Intriguing.
- I told you that, didn't I? - You did. But...
I didn't know  if you were kidding.
Because you're a comedienne.
Anyhow, I've helped  tons of comics
shape acts over the years.
And I've dabbled in TV a little.
Wrote an episode of Our Miss Brooks.
- Do you know it? - I love that show.
Eve Arden's a dream.
A real dream.
So please, talk.
Well, I did a slot  a few nights ago
talking about a new job I got, as a makeup counter girl.
I thought it was a natural,
and I... bombed.
Bigtime.
It was scary.
I'm getting clammy  just thinking about it.
It's also warm in here.
This what I've been drawing from
my comedy notebook.
It's just some  random funny thoughts
I've written down  over the years.
I need someone like you  to make sense of it.
Minnie Pearl has a comedy notebook.
Puts you in a good company.
"I know you're  probably thinking,
"'If I wanted to hear  a woman yapping,
"I'd have stayed home.'
"But there's no way your mothers
are as funny as I am."
Solid joke.
Tell me more about you.
Well, I've primarily been  a housewife
for the last five years.
A funny Betty Crocker  that's interesting.
Any kids?
- Two. - Perfect.
The Doyenne of Domesticity.
That could be a thing.
Well, I'd love to help.
And I can dive in today.
It's 15 bucks for the first  five minutes of material.
Sound good?
Sounds very good.
Tell me more.
I went to Bryn Mawr.
Definitely the funniest  of the seven sisters.
Then brush the color  onto the lid, just lightly,
and stop right here,
about half an inch  before you reach the eyebrow.
I'll never be able  to recreate this tomorrow.
No problem.  I'm coming home with you.
Saw this for you  in the break room.
Thanks, Harriet. Excuse me.
Is that a pickle?
I believe it is a pickle.
Ladies, will you excuse me  just a quick moment?
Absolutely.
Deli.
Yes, hello. Is Herb Smith there?
Herb? Phone.
Do they sound angry?  I'm not your fuckin' secretary.
Just come get it.
This is Herb.  Herb, hi. Midge Maisel.
And not the IRS? Thank God.
- Good one. - You get my package?
Shipped it out this morning.
I did get it.  And I'm a little confused.
I don't know if you got the five messages I left you,
but I have a slot at the Gaslight tonight.
The Gaslight?  So you know Susie Myerson.
- She's terrific. - She is.
But I don't have  a lot of time to prepare,
and I'm just wondering  what the deal is
- with the threebyfive cards. - They're your act.
But... I have no time  to memorize all this.
So you take them up on stage.
It's how all the greats  worked out their acts.
Bob Hope, Moms Mabley  everybody uses cards.
Yeah, I've seen comics  use cards.
It's fun for the audience to see  a comic working like this.
It can be hitandmiss at times,  but lots of fun.
- I guess. - Just have a stool next to you.
You can put the cards  on the stool.
The Gaslight has a stool,  doesn't it?
They do have a stool.
I should have put the stool  in the cards.
The stool is a big thing.
- You see the pickle? - I did see the pickle.
The pickle's funny.
The pickle is funny.  So...
break a leg.
Uh, I will. Thank you, Herb.
Can't wait to hear how it goes.
Bye.
I'm back, ladies.
- Now, where were we? - You were on the lids.
Ah, yes.
And next up...
we start from the top,
and then slowly work  our way down.
Just had to see it for myself.
La mer
Qu'on voit danser
Le long des...
Flats are making  a giant difference.
I'm glad. I'm just home  for a quick change,
and then I'm heading out.
- I'm meeting a friend  for dinner. - Okay.
I'll pick up the kids from  Mrs. Fulber when I get home.
So, I saw them unboxing  some new dresses
on the seventh floor today.
I'm not even supposed  to be up there,
but I just shoot the security guard a wink,
and he looks the other way.
Some Chanel came in  to die for.
And there was this pink one  with a little collar
that was just screaming my name.
There was this purply one,  gloves to match,
that just seemed so you.
Hi, Mommy.
Mama, Ethan and Esther are  supposed to be with Mrs. Fulber.
Fulber's a drunk.
- Come on. - Uh, no.
No. He's the storyteller,  not me.
Ma, you're a great storyteller.
If you don't mind 180 degree turns halfway through the story.
Moishe.
- What? - Don't tease.
I'm not teasing.  I'm reporting.
What did I tell you?  Greatest show on earth.
You start a story  about a TV repairman,
and then you end it  describing a cruise to Istanbul.
I don't find that normal.
I did love that cruise.
- I would love to go on a cruise. - We should take a cruise.
Everyone should go on a cruise.
Except Joel  he gets tummy sick.
- One time. - And it  wasn't even on a cruise ship.
It was on  the Staten Island Ferry,
to visit his cousins  in Bulls Head.
Ma, this is a story  you should not tell.
I want to hear it.
He threw up.  That's the story.
Great story.  And she got to the end
without talking about elephants  or the Charleston.
Give your mother some credit.
Young lady, we want to know more  about you.
Cutting it close there, gally.
Sorry. Subway stopped  between stations.
We were in pitch black forever.
Pretty sure some guy groped me.
- Well, sometimes you get lucky. - Just give me
- a minute to calm down. - You're going on,
you got to get on.  Crowd's gonna thin out.
- Just a quick minute. - Midge next?
- Midge next. - What stupid
fucking name are using  this time?
Sadie Morton.
Why not?
What are those?
Just some notes.
You wrote your act on cards?
- Yeah.  - Why?
It's good enough for Bob Hope,  it's good enough for me.
Since when do you pattern  yourself after Bob Hope?
All right, next up  is a really funny comedian.
Give it up for Sadie Morton!
Like that's a real thing.
Hi there, everybody.
Yup. Drink it in  a woman comedian.
A rare sighting.
I know you're probably thinking,  "If I wanted
to hear a woman yapping,  I'd have stayed home."
But there is no way  your mothers are as funny as me.
All right, all right,  we're having fun here.
So I'm a mother, too,  believe it or not,
of three rambunctious kids.
Okay, II have two kids,  not three. Oh.
Uh, one day, my oldest came home  from junior high
and said the craziest thing.
Okay, I'mI'm 26.
II didn't give birth at 13.
I would have had to have  given birth at 13.
Uhuh. Cancan I borrow a pen?
Mm.  Thank you.
When I was a kid, my parents  told me I was their favorite,
and that's not just because  I'm an only child.
I actually have a brother,
so that's another thing  that's not quite... accurate.
Uh... youyou know,
my family fights so much  at the dinner table,
I'm thinking of putting up  four ropes and selling tickets.
- I don't get that.  - It's a boxing thing.
A boxing thing.
Oh. Oh, okay, I get it.  Thank you, sir.
My husband.
Ooh, I get so mad  when he comes home late,
I grab the frying pan,  hit him over the head,
and doink.
Doink?
AnAnd... and my mother  is so nosy,
I think she could win a gold medal.
That's MEDDLE,  notnot MEDAL.
It's more of a visual  spelling joke, I guess. See...
Wow. How did Bob Hope  become Bob Hope?
Because he's funny.
Thank you, sir.
Light's on me, not you.
I went to Bryn Mawr.
That's literally all it says.
Next card.
Next comedian.
- Excuse me?  - Bring back the banjo.
You think  you could do better, asshole?
- Probably.  - Oh, great.
Then stand up  and make 'em laugh.
Come on. Let's see what you got.
What? You leave your balls  at home?
Fine.
Um, a Spanish magician  tells the audience
he'll disappear on the count of three.
He says, "Uno, dos." Poof.
He disappeared  without a tres.
I quit.
Why doesn't this stupid place  have a backstage?
Are you trying to humiliate me?
You're doing a great job  all by yourself.
- What the fuck?  - Don't.
I mean, what the fuck?
I just want  to get the hell out of here.
This isn't even your writing.
Hi, Midge.
What are you doing here?
I came to catch your set.
Nice job.
Nice job?  Were you listening?
The whole time.
You got some good laughs  in the back there.
How far back were you,  Cafe Wha?
Okay, I'm just trying  to catch up here.
- How do you know Herb Smith?  She answered my ad
- in the Hollywood Reporter.  - Hi, Susie.
You hired the Stage Deli bottomfeeder to write your act?
All based on her notebook.
Lot of good stuff in there.
Nothing from these cards  came from my notebook.
Yeah, because he sells  the same crappy jokes
to everyone who hires him.
- He's a fuckin' recycler!  - Didn't say that in the ad.
That would have been  a dumb thing to put in the ad.
I told you it'd be hitandmiss!
It was all miss, Herb.  Nothing hit!
Please tell me  you did not pay this guy.
- Oh, I paid him.  - Without consulting me?
Hey, Midge, one thought?
Oh, he's got a thought.
The husband joke.
When you hit him over the head  with the frying pan,
it's not "doink."
It's...  "Doyyoyyoyyoyyoink!"
Herb, the thing I'm gonna  hit you over the head with,
your screams are gonna drown out  the doyyoyyoyyoyyoyyoink!
- We got to talk.  - Goodbye, Herb.
Herb Smith.
- Really?  - I needed help.
So you hire a guy  that'll work for salami?
I didn't want to bomb again.
Oh, mission accomplished.
Geez. If I wanted  an act like that,
I'd have booked your husband.
- Real nice. - I thought  we were doing this together.
- Are we not doing this together?  - I'm here, aren't I?
You go behind my back,  you hire a guy to help you.
I'm here to help you.
How? By rushing me on stage  when I wasn't even ready?
- What are you talking about?  - I hardly stepped in the door
and you were pushing me  to go on.
- I wanted you to have  a good audience. - Great job.
- So it's my fault.  - Yes.
- Hey, fuck you.  - No, fuck you.
What is wrong with you?
I can't do this anymore.
- Don't.  - I can't do it.
I...I don't want to do it.
We've talked about bombing.
So you get up on stage and bomb.  See how you like it.
- I'd hate it.  - Well, there you go.
But I'm not a comedian.  You're the comedian.
- Not anymore.  - Bullshit.
- Not anymore.  - Oh. Again?
Okay, fine. So you're  not gonna do this?
- Nope.  - You're giving up?
Yeah.
Fine.
Go get your purse.
Go on home.
But this is goodbye, Miriam.
Or Sadie, or Cuntsy Lou Who  or whatever your name is.
Because that's all  you and I are.
Professional relationship.  Not girlfriends.
I know that.  And if there's no profession,
there's no relationship,  capisce?
Goodbye.
Uh, don't forget  your comedy cards.
You paid good money for them.
Don't forget to cancel that phone you ordered.
Unless it's too late.
Oh, don't worry.  I didn't order the stupid phone.
Maybe I can instinctively  smell a loser!
Fine!
So the priest turns  to the nun and says,
"Excuse me,  are you staring at me?"
Is this a dirty joke?  Would I tell a dirty joke
- in mixed company?  - Yes. - Yes.
It's not a dirty joke.
Eat that, honey.  Eat it so that I won't.
So, the nun says to the priest,
"I remember you.  We met once at the Vatican."
- This is a dirty joke.  - Not a dirty joke.
And so, the priest says,  "The Vatican's full
"of a lot of priests, all in  robes who look just like me.
How do you know that was me?"
And the nun says...
This is a dirty joke.
- I knew it.  - So did I.
All right. I'll resume  smelling my dessert wine
and acting like I know  what the hell I'm talking about.
Excuse me, everyone,  I'm going to go freshen up.
Because you're stale?
I'll come with you,  because I am definitely stale.
You're gorgeous, too, Shirl.
You're killing me  with that tiny tush.
Oh, Mrs. Maisel...
- No.  - What?
- Her. No. - What the hell  are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
How would I know  what you're talking about?
She's young, she's emptyheaded,
she doesn't eat. She's a shiksa.
So?  Shiksas are for practice.
Want to say that  a little louder?
I think you heard me just fine.
I don't believe this.
Don't act like a child.
You can't judge her like this.
You don't even know her.
I know enough. That is a girl
that you have on the side, Joel.
It's not a girl you marry.
You don't introduce her to your fucking parents.
I had Yankees tickets tonight.
She's a good girl. Sweet.
"Sweet." Good.  Sounds like a Danish.
You'd hate her no matter what.  Yeah. Convince yourself
of that and then we'll talk.
No.
I'm eating her dessert.
Oh, there she is.
I stole I stole your dessert.
That's okay, Mrs. Maisel.
Oh, call me Shirley.
Oh.  MOISHE: I've got another joke.
It's gonna be dirty again.  It's not gonna be dirty.
So, a clown walks  into a laundromat.
SHIRLEY: This is dirty.
MOISHE:  There's nothing dirty about it.
SHIRLEY:  He told this joke five years ago
in front of the rabbi.
MOISHE: Wait, is this  the dirty temple joke?
SHIRLEY:  It's the dirty temple joke.
MOISHE:  Are you sure?
SHIRLEY: It ends with  cabbage up the chimney.
MOISHE: You're right, it's too  dirty. Funny, but too dirty.
Okay. Knock, knock.  SHIRLEY : Moishe...
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever  what a girl supposes
Stage door Johny's outraging
Over you with gems  and roses...
Hi, Midge. Morning.  Good morning.
Morning.
When you let a feller  hold your hand
Which means an extra beer  or sandwich...
Doors are opening.
And it begins.  Good luck.
Excuse me.
Where's the kitchenware  department?
Fourth floor.  Thank you.
No, wait. Sixth.
Nope. Fifth.  MARY: Uh, kitchenware's
on the third floor,  southwest side.
Thank you.
You okay?  Yeah. I'm just tired.
You look like you haven't  had any fun lately.
That's for sure.
Then you should come to my party  tonight. It's nothing fancy.
Cheap wine and pretzels  and extremely dull boys.
Way to sell.
No, really. It'll be fun.
Life upon the wicked stage   Maybe.
Ain't nothing for a girl.   Thanks for the invite.
Hello?  ARCHIE: Joel, hi. It's me.
Hey, Arch.  We were just about to step out.
We, uh, meeting  in the lobby or outside?
Joel, sorry,  but we got to beg off.
What? We're stuck here.  Babysitter just canceled.
She canceled?
Last second.  She's never done this.
Call another.  You got, like, four of them.
Yeah. They're all booked.
Oh. Well...
I could call Mrs. Moskowitz  and see if she could...
And Imogene's not feeling well.
Cold, or something.
Can we take a raincheck?
It's a Broadway show.  There's no raincheck.
I know.
I feel terrible.
Arch.  I'm sorry, buddy.
Really.
I'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
Bye.
A Bebop baby
A Bebop  baby
A Bebop baby
She's the gal for me
She got plenty of rhythm,  got plenty of jive
And when we dance,  it really comes alive
My love for her's  so tender and sweet
My heart starts pounding  every time we meet
A Bebop baby  still in her teens
Just as sweet  as she can be...
Hi, there. Midge, right?  From makeup?
Oh, yes.  Arnie. Menswear.
Schlitz?  Thank you, Arnie.
So how you liking the job?  I like it.
Lot of nice girls  down in makeup.
Very nice.  It's all men up where I am.
Comes with the territory.
So you like Ricky Nelson?  What I've heard.
It's funny how we all grew up  watching him on TV,
now he's this big rock star.
The next Elvis.  Very funny.
She's the gal for me...
Oh, were you hitting on me?
Oh, no, I...  You are. That's so sweet,
but that's not  why I'm here, Arnie.
I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry.
Uh, did you want  the Schlitz back?
No, it's fine.
Enjoy.  Thank you.
Midge.
You came.  I did.
Ah!  Nice place.
Eh, it's, uh, it's home for now.
Uh, Vivian, Harriet,  look what the cat dragged in.
Oh. Hi, Midge.
Vivian's drunk.  I'm not a drunk.
I didn't say you were a drunk.  I said you were drunk.
Honey, you have two cups.  What's up with that?
I poured myself a vodka and  I forgot, and I poured a gin.
Guess I could mix 'em.
Oh, Vivian, no, no, no, no, no.
You will thank me  in the morning.
She's not gonna be thanking  anyone in the morning.
I'll keep Vivian close tonight.
I'm not a child.
Hey, we've all done this.
I once mixed tequila,  absinthe and red wine.
Ooh. Ouch.  Came out pink.
I'd never puked  my favorite color before.
I don't even much like  the taste of alcohol.
Oh, me either.
But I like being tipsy.  Mmm.
I mean, I wish  there was a pill...
II guess there is.  It's called "pills."
Hi, girls. Uh, what happened  to all the guys?
They're clustered in a corner.
Why do they do that?
Why do they cluster like that?
Because we intimidate them  or because
they're finally admitting they  don't know anything about cars?
Lots of tears  and catharsis over that.
Or maybe they're just hoping to  start a really easily winnable
game of tug of war.  Or it's just a bunch of guys
who didn't make their high  school team talking about
how Mickey Mantle  can improve his swing.
Hi, Rose.
Did Midge tell you?  I'm bringing Ethan back.
See you later, sport.
Bye, Daddy.
Your wife is working.
Your first apartment?
My very first.
You know, I never had  a first apartment.
I lived with my folks,  went to college, got married.
I've never  killed my own spiders.
What do you do  if you see one?
I assume  just get a new apartment.
Really, three girls  and one bathroom?
And you haven't  tried to kill each other yet?
Just... attack each other  with eyelash curlers,
karate each other  with bra straps
what happens here?  It's frightening.
