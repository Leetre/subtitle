Your Grace.
I have news.
We know where the Northmen are.
They're at York.
They captured the town with great slaughter.
They murdered Bishop Cynebert most horribly.
Then we know what we must do to them in return.
You have confessed your guilt.
Yes.
So that all could hear.
Then tell me why I should not kill you.
You have no reason to kill me.
No reason?
Do I not have half a reason?
No.
Everything has changed.
I did what I did because of a woman.
She refused to marry me unless I became King of all Norway.
So that was my idea.
That was my passion.
I loved her, you see.
So,
I tried to take your kingdom.
I had nothing against you.
It was just to be worthy of her.
Then why has everything changed?
Because she lied to me.
She couldn't wait for me to become King of Norway.
She married a Danish Earl instead.
And what did you do?
I killed her.
And now that she is dead,
I no longer have any intentions to attack Kattegat
or try to remove you as its ruler.
People do things for love...
Don't they, Queen Lagertha?
So then, what are your intentions?
I want to offer you my friendship and alliance.
Look at you.
Do you think you are in a position to offer me anything?
I'm still a King!
With lordship over many kingdoms.
And I am Queen!
Indeed.
And I know, above all people,
how vulnerable Kattegat and its beautiful Queen has become.
After all, your son might be away for a long time.
And how much do you trust the other sons of Ragnar?
Do they still not desire vengeance for their mother's death?
Or imagine themselves as Kings here?
And what would you want in return for this alliance?
You have no man in your life, and I no woman.
Perhaps that's one answer to your question.
Do you really think, "King" Harald,
that I would prostrate myself at your feet,
and offer thanks to the gods that you would deign to be my husband?
And that I should be grateful
for you that you would offer to come to my bed?
In all your glory?
What...
What are you doing, woman?
Let us through.
Do you know who we are?
We know who you are.
What do you want?
I want to speak to my brother Ivar.
Now, get out of my way.
I'll ask him and see if it's all right.
No, you won't.
Because you will not have a tongue to ask him with.
I will nail you to that post just over there.
Do you understand?
Ubbe! Hvitserk!
Did you take a look around?
The work on strengthening the defenses is going well.
Why do you need a personal bodyguard, Ivar?
What?
We were just stopped by your bodyguards.
Why do you need them?
Do you need protection against us?
Against your brothers?
Of course not.
Then why have them?
I'm a cripple.
I need a bodyguard.
It's not just the bodyguard, Ivar.
The fact is, you never seem to consult us about anything.
It's as if you think you are now the leader of our Great Army.
Do you think you are the leader?
No, I don't.
Why would I ever think such a thing?
I'm glad to hear you say that because you are not the leader.
We three brothers are the leaders together.
As our father would have wished.
We are older than you, Ivar.
You can't push us aside.
It's unacceptable.
No, you're right, Hvitserk.
But you two have to understand
that it is harder for me to share and to stake my claim.
I truly want to be your equal
but in order for me to do so, I have to do better than you.
I have to make you forget that I'm a cripple.
Listen, Ivar, we know what you are.
And we accept what you are.
It makes no difference to us.
You are just our brother.
Don't try to make us feel sorry for you.
Because, my brother, we never will.
There's a large Saxon force on its way here.
But I thought you'd already know that.
Well?
He explained himself.
He explained why he tried to kill all of us?
He was in love.
In any case, he's not in love anymore.
He wants to make a deal with us.
So you told him we do not make deals with murderers.
I told him it depends on the offer.
What is he offering?
Alliance.
Protection.
In return for...
Marriage.
That's it?
Surely you can't entertain that?
Doesn't he know who you are?
Of course he does, that's the point.
I would never let a man like that get anywhere near me!
You can't be so pure.
Sometimes women have to do what women have to do, just to keep a bit of power.
That is what you say.
There is an element of truth in what Torvi says.
In any case,
I've no intention of marrying him.
Then you will kill him?
That's none of your business.
You can't set him free!
Whatever I decide is nothing to do with you.
- I was only thinking of you. - Thank you.
But I can think for myself.
Row.
Get to the boats!
- They've gone! - Who has gone?
King Harald and his men.
Their boats have gone. They freed him
and killed some of the guards.
Where is Astrid?
Astrid?
MAN: Hold the rampart!
MAN 1: Row!
MAN 2: No slowing down now!
MAN 3: Heave!
MAN: Pull! Pull!
MAN: Go faster!
Why kidnap me?
Oh, you can help me a great deal.
You see, I think Lagertha's years are numbered as Queen of Kattegat.
And I still have ambitions to rule there.
MAN: Pull!
I still intend to become King of all Norway.
Which means I shall take over Kattegat, among other kingdoms.
But I remain unmarried.
I need a Queen.
I need to breed and produce sons.
You want me to be your Queen?
Why not?
You have to understand.
Lagertha has been so good to me.
I owe her everything.
Then there is no way that you will ever agree to marry me?
No.
Even if it means you will become Queen of Norway?
The most powerful woman in the whole country?
Tell me honestly, Astrid,
doesn't that appeal to you at all?
Doesn't that make your blood race just a little quicker?
Don't your eyes shine just a little brighter?
Or have I misjudged you?
Pass it down here and pull.
Heave!
Well? What have you to report?
The Northmen have been busy
repairing and improving the town's defenses, Your Grace.
They are an industrious people.
They are pagans and devils. Nothing more. Go on.
The town is well defended.
Begging your pardon, but Your Grace may not yet be strong enough
to attack her. Not with any hope of success.
I disagree.
I have every hope of success.
It is a pity the new King is not here with us.
His presence in the field might encourage new recruits.
Unlike his father, he has some credit as a warrior.
What will we do about Alfred?
Why must we always talk about Alfred?
Because he's dying, Aethelwulf.
He's dying before your eyes.
Can't you see?
Alfred?
Alfred?
Alfred?
Alfred.
What's he doing?
Alfred?
Alfred!
No!
Save him!
Alfred?
Save my boy!
Move!
Alfred! My boy!
My life!
No!
No!
No. No!
Please, please,please, please!
No, please!
My boy! Please!
He's alive!
He's alive!
Shh, shh! He's trying to talk.
ALFRED: York.
We must... We must go to York.
Why must we go to York?
The Northmen are there.
The Northmen.
And your...
Your people need you.
Alfred, how... How do you know?
My father told me.
Oh, you gods.
Not like this.
I don't want to die like this.
Why have you abandoned me?
Heimdall, watchman,
you can vouch for me!
Tell the other gods how often I think of them,
and how my heart belongs to them.
Be gone, bird.
Find a perch of land and stay there.
Don't come back.
Don't come back!
SOLDIER: Hold your line!
Come on, men! Push, push!
SOLDIER: Come on!
SOLDIER: Forward!
Keep going! Push!
One more!
TORVI: Why do you think he kidnapped Astrid?
I don't think King Harald ever does anything without thought.
He told me that he had abandoned his dreams
of becoming King of all Norway.
I am sure he was lying.
He still believes in his dreams,
and, one day, his ships will return to Kattegat full of warriors.
Astrid must be part of his plan. But...
What part, I cannot say.
Astrid will never be part of someone else's plan.
I am old enough to know that you can never say for sure
what someone else will do.
That's it. Row!
I can smell home!
Keep rowing!
Keep the distance!
Not long now.
Keep it going, men!
Tie it fast!
Have you thought any more about what I said?
I'm sure you don't like the look of me
but you will change your mind.
I will never marry you.
You have made a big mistake.
Oh, it's true.
I've never had any luck with women.
So why should you be any different?
I think you've kidnapped the wrong woman.
You are right, of course.
That is what I did.
And yet...
What if, by mistake, by accident, by the gods,
and by fate, I made the right decision?
What if you were always meant to be here?
What if there was no place else for you to be?
Row!
Row!
Halt!
Dismount!
Who are you?
We are men of Wessex. We are here with our King.
With your King? Do you mean King Aethelwulf?
Son of Ecbert?
He and his men are following close behind.
I am a companion of His Grace, Bishop Heahmund,
who is camped not very far from here.
My name is Lord Denewulf.
Then well met, My Lord.
Well met, indeed.
This is a happy day.
My Lord Bishop was anxious for the King to be at his side.
And now, thank God, it has come to pass.
Help me out.
Make room for their horses.
Most noble King,
by God's grace.
My Lord Bishop.
We've heard many reports of your prowess with arms,
and of your personal sanctity.
We mean to model our lives upon yours.
My wife, Judith.
Noble lady.
Come!
Refresh yourself after your long journey,
and eat.
Make way for the carts!
What courage you have, my lady,
to accompany your husband here.
I'm not so brave, Bishop Heahmund.
But as my husband and my sons elect to be on the field of battle,
then what should I do?
Stay at home and weep and pray?
In any case, as the daughter of King Aelle,
I too have a score to settle with these sons of Ragnar.
I confess...
I'd forgotten that you'd suffered as much personal grief and loss as the King
and stand as much in need of justice as he does.
In the name of God, who is both vengeful and merciful,
I swear I will make these pagans pay
for their cruelty and their crimes.
There's plenty to go 'round!
Prince Alfred?
- Yes, My Lord. - Forgive me.
I have heard stories about you already.
How you traveled to Rome as a boy, and met His Holiness.
Yes. My father took me.
It must have been an arduous journey for one so young?
Well, is anything truly worthwhile not likely to be difficult, my Lord Bishop?
Well said.
Who was your tutor?
My grandfather, King Ecbert.
He was the wisest man I ever knew,
and the most loving.
The barbarians who now occupy York
are responsible for his death.
That's why we are here.
The Northmen have been reinforcing the defenses of the town.
They have repaired and extended the ramparts.
That is bad news.
I thought so too.
That is, until my scouts reported something interesting.
Apparently, they have felt unable or unwilling
to repair the old Roman walls that are still standing.
In fact, in several places, the walls are crumbling.
The stones are loosened and likely to fall.
Even so, they remain unguarded
and unprotected.
Then we have a plan of attack.
We do.
With your permission,
we should wait,
not rush.
Let our armies be combined.
Let my scouts determine with absolute certainty
that those sections of wall remain unguarded and unprotected.
Yes, and I can contact my father's earldormen and ask them to join us.
And when all that is done?
Yes, my Prince.
When all that is done, we shall attack.
Scouts!
Bring up the shield!
What do you think about Lagertha's mistake?
What do you mean "mistake"?
She ought to have killed King Harald when she had the chance.
Instead of just talking to him.
Perhaps.
Not allowed her enemy, our enemy, to escape.
And she sacrificed the life of Astrid.
We don't know that.
Listen, all I'm saying is that Lagertha is fallible.
She makes mistakes.
Maybe her grip of power is not as fierce or complete as it once was.
Can't you see that?
Ivar?
Ah, what are you doing?
Wait and I'll show you.
Ready.
