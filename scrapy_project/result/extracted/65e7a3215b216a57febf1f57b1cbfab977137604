00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,280
- 如果你想去买...          - 也许是去做个足部护理
- So, if you wanna shop... - Maybe a pedicure.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,400
足部护理？
A pedicure?

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,880
好吧，这就是我们的要结束地方，好了
Okay, that's where we draw the line. That's it.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,110
但无论如何，去今日网
But in any event,go to today.com

尽管有各种条条款款

00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,610
但这就是我想要你做的，因为我想
and what you need to do,'cause I'd love to come

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,450
和你一起醒来，好的!

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,120
早餐，拖拉机驾驶和铲...
Breakfast, tractor driving and shoveling...

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,590
嘿，波士顿马拉松赛就在
Hey, big Boston Marathon,

12

明天早上9点

轮椅马拉松在中午举行

14
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,760
气温大约在50度，阳光明媚

将会是是个美好的一天
It's gonna be a perfect day.

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,300
你知道，红袜队在最近两场比赛后
You know,there is a renewed hope

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,210
有了更大赢的希望...
for the Red Sox after two of the last plays...

19
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,480
你好，约翰，我对今年的感觉很好
Here we go, John.Feeling good about this year.

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,420
- 借你吉言     - 红袜队加油
- You said it. - Go Sox.

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,010
不会吧？
Seriously?

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,860
嘿，汤姆！先别喷，让我过一下
Hey, Tom! Don't spray.I'm walkin' through here.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,480
什么味道？
What's that smell?

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,140
该死
Shit.

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,680
啊！妈的！
Ah! Shit!

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,980
你做了什么？
What'd you do?

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,160
我设置了定时
I'd been checkin' on the timer,

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,340
我没有弄错
I didn't turn on by mistake,

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,960
但我没有听到警报声，我没有听到哔声
so I didn't hear the noise,I didn't hear the beep.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,870
如果你听到了哔声，或许你就能够
And if you hear the beeps,then you'd be able

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,980
- 及时关掉它...  - 你应该
- to stop 'em... - You're supposed to

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,410
在清理垃圾之前清空烤箱，杰夫
clear the roasters before you empty the trash, Jeff.

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,520
...可我没有听到哔声
...'Cause I didn't hear the beeps.

34
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,170
玛雅，我会给你算一个小时的加班
Okay, Maya, I'll sign off on an hour of OT,

35
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,700
杰夫会和你一起清理，这样安排
so Jeff can help clean up.Does that work

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,490
- 你们觉得可以吗？      - 其实，我...
- for both of you guys? - Actually, sir, there's...

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,900
我还有其他的事
I got something I gotta do.

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,570
什么事那么重要...
What do you got's so important...

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,900
你刚刚犯下了一个大错
You just make this big mess

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,270
你就准备撒手不管了？
and leave me here to clean it up?

41
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,740
听着，红袜队因为我
Look, the Sox lost two in a row

42
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,340
连输了两场，好吗？
because of me, all right?

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,340
我因为工作而错过了两场比赛
I missed both games because I was at work.

44
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,240
因为我没有在我的幸运座位上喝着我的幸运啤酒
I wasn't in my lucky seat with my lucky beer.

45
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,980
你还有幸运啤酒？
You got a lucky beer?

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,370
是的，我是说，我只是...
Yeah, I mean, I just...

47
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,000
一般来说啤酒是有好运的，对吧？
Beer in general's lucky, right?

48
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,300
好的，你来决定，玛雅
Okay, this is your call, Maya.

49
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,300
好吧
All right.

50
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,920
我自己来吧，看看你这样
I got you. Look at you.

51
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,750
谢谢，玛雅
Thank you, Maya.

52
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,980
你欠我一个人情
You owe me.

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,070
帮我个忙
Do me a favor, sir.

54
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,370
不要上报我们办公室恋情，好吗？
Don't report our office romance, okay?

55
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,800
我知道这有违好市多的规定
I know it's against Costco policy,

56
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,920
但有时候你必须做出点牺牲，不是吗？
but sometimes you gotta make a sacrifice, right?

57
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,050
快去看比赛吧
Please go watch the game.

58
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,000
我的小宝贝来了
Here's my baby boy.

59
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,120
我可以续杯吗？
Can I get another pitcher?

60
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,890
你不觉得
Don't you think

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,260
他有点太瘦了，帕蒂？
he's gettin' too skinny, Patty?

62
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,520
而且还他妈的非常需要去理个发
And he needs a fuckin' haircut.

63
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,910
那就非常完美了
Friggin' perfect.

64
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,410
看看那张脸
Look at that face.

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,010
实在太可爱了
The face is cute.

66
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,010
我去
Shit!

67
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,180
哦，妈，嘿
Oh, Ma, hey.

68
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,540
- 她没事      - 小心点
- She's good. - Careful, there.

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,090
你想坐在低点的地方吗？那一跤太搞笑了
You wanna sit somewhere lower?That fall's a doozy.

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,960
你他妈的给我滚一边儿，亲爱的
Yeah, you go fuck yourself, sweetie.

71
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,050
好的，谢谢，嘿
All right, thanks. Hey.

72
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,520
他是我最喜欢的外甥
He's my favorite nephew.

73
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,740
天啊，杰夫
Jesus, Jeff,

74
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,270
你闻起来他妈一股死鸡味
you still smell like fuckin' chicken carcasses.

75
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,150
巴克霍尔兹占上风了，快看
Buchholz is on fire.Look at him.

76
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,180
他就是一只该死的野兽
He's a fuckin' beast.

77
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,660
你也可以的，小德
That coulda been you, D.

78
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,820
上电视，有钱又有名
On TV. Rich and famous.

79
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,910
奎特在高中时投球就像一个该死的娘娘腔
Quit pitchin' in high school like a fuckin' pussy.

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,580
你才是娘娘腔，闭嘴，死基佬
You're a pussy.Shut up,faggot.

81
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,880
现在没人用“基佬”这个词了，小德
Nobody says "faggot" anymore, D.

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,980
哦，是吗？你又知道些什么？
Oh, really? What do you know about it, huh?

83
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,650
你什么意思？我和同性恋一起工作
What do you mean?I'm down with the homos.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
我好市多的老板就是同性恋
My boss at Costco's gay.

85
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,060
你那该死的老板？
Your fuckin' boss?

86
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,630
你以为我他妈的
You think I get this fashionable

87
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,490
在没有内部帮助的情况下就这么受欢迎了？
without it's some sort of fuckin' insider help?

88
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,460
先说清楚，嘿...
For the record, hey...

89
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,940
先说清楚，我没有像娘娘腔的投球
For the record,I didn't pussy outta shit.

90
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,660
我椎间盘突出，你们都知道的
I had a herniated disk.You both know that.

91
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,110
闭上嘴吧，你们几个
Shut the fuck up, both of you.

92
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,550
你是个混蛋，闭嘴
You're an asshole. Shut up.

93
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,970
谁叫你基佬，德里克？
Who you callin' a faggot, Derek?

94
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,310
没人，显然我们已经不再说那个词了，鲍勃叔叔
No, apparently we don't say that word no more, Uncle Bob.

95
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,910
跟你说，杰夫的老板是同性恋
You know, Jeff's boss is a gay.

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,780
什么？他的确是！
What? He is!

97
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,870
你刚刚去哪了？
Where have you been?

98
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,160
显然不是和我们在一块
Not with the rest of us, apparently.

99
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,190
鲍曼？你是中风了还是怎么了？
Bauman? You havin' a stroke or somethin'?

100
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,830
哦，该死，看看谁来了
Oh, shit.Look who's here.

101
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,570
嘿，等一下
Hey, give me a second.

102
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,840
没人想操一个长着鸡头的家伙
Nobody wants to fuck a guy with chicken in his hair.

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,640
你为什么碰我头发，鲍勃叔叔
Why you touchin' my hair,Uncle Bob?

104
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,140
她一骂你就马上回来，知道吗？
Come back after she tells you to go fuck yourself, okay?

105
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,240
还是坐下看比赛吧，兄弟
Sit down and watch the game, bro.

106
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,020
她和你分手了
She broke up with you.

107
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,150
嘿
Hey.

108
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,530
你是...
Are you...

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,550
什么？
What?

110
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,930
你...
Are...

111
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,410
她姐姐也来了
The sister's here.

112
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,750
- 谁？盖尔？ - 嗯
- Who? Gail? - Yeah.

113
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,040
她看起来不错嘛
She looks good, though.

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,140
- 嘿   - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

115
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,270
我，我...我给你发了短信
I, like... I texted you,

116
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,910
大概有六次，你都没有...
like, six times.You never get...

117
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,070
你有收到我的短信吗？
Did you get my texts or not?

118
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,800
收到了，我都收到了
Yeah, yeah, I did.Yeah, I got 'em.

119
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,760
好的
Cool.

120
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,940
- 嘿，盖尔   - 杰夫
- Hey, Gail. - Jeff.

121
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,190
那么你们两个埃姆斯伯里的女士
So what are you two Amesbury ladies

122
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,750
在这里干什么呢？
slummin' it here for, anyway?

123
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,680
我正在为马拉松赛筹款
I'm collecting donations for the Marathon.

124
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,530
真的吗？
No shit?

125
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,510
是的
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

126
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,940
- 很好       - 嗯
- All right. - Yep.

127
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,540
你有一个罐子，是吧？上面还有你的照片
You got a jar, huh?With pictures of yourself.

128
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,420
很不错
That's so great.

129
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,710
所以你就给人看你的照片
So you show people pictures of yourself

130
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,140
然后你就向他们要点钱
and then you ask for money.

131
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,070
是的，很有用
Yes. It usually works.

132
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,200
这个...这个主意不错
That's very...That's a smart idea.

133
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,110
感觉你在提升自我
It feels like you're self-promoting.

134
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,240
这真的...
That's really...

135
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,160
我是在提升，这正是我正在做的
I am. That's literally what I'm doing.

136
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,180
好的，但是你知道吗？如果你到处传播
Yeah, but you know what?Like, if you try and pass this

137
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,280
你自己的照片
around with pictures of yourself,

138
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,820
这会变得，会变得...

差点给我吓出心脏病来

Where she also works as a big-shot administrator.

谁能想到最后变成了像是一出
Whoever thought you'd end up being in, like,

165
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,700

166
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,670
你对他有什么意见吗？他人挺好的
What do you have against him? He's a nice guy.

Will you get me some aspirin?'Cause I can't reach.

195
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,690

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,530
我脑袋里像是有只拿着大铁锤的小老鼠
Tiny mice with big hammers in my skull.

201
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,780
我够不到阿司匹林

我天，你为什么总把它放那？
My God. Why do you always put it up here?

205
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,110
谁会放那么高啊？我真搞不懂
Who puts it up here?I don't understand.

206

What? You mean the low battery alarm on the smoke detector?

还好不是很远
That's not a long drive.

214
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,630
你就不能叫
You can't have Uncle Bob come by

215
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,160
鲍勃叔叔来弄吗？
and do it on his way to work?

216
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,760
我的天啊

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,430
你那是什么？
What you got there?

没什么
It's just a thing.

219
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,290
我不明白你为什么一直对那个女孩念念不忘
I don't know why you keep tryin' with that girl anyway.

220
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,640
嘿，等下，我做了早餐

235
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,300
他们要做什么？

像是一个酒吧
Just a bar.

239
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,700
我不太清楚...
I don't know...

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,600
你要怎么回家？
How are you gettin' home?

你知道他们会告诉你

259
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,970
他是否已经死了，不是吗？

260
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,670
你怎么可能知道，凯伦？
How do you even know that,Karen?

261
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,700
因为我在这家该死的医院

度过了我的大半辈子

好吧，不是什么都是关于你的！
Well, this ain't about you!

264
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,970
我没有那么说！天啊！

你们能闭嘴吗？

267
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,140
你们现在不可以吵，不可以
You can't right now, you can't.

268
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,680
我的儿子他妈的在哪？

269
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,600
到底发生了什么事？

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,340
别告诉我该怎么做，鲍勃！
Don't tell me what to do, Bob!

274
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
帕蒂，你对我的儿子做了什么？
Patty, what's going on with my son?

275
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,020
我们现在还不知道情况
We don't know yet.

276
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,520
- 鲍曼的家属？- 在这！
- Bauman family? - Yes!

277
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,370
鲍曼的家属！
Bauman!

278
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,260
在这，我们是...
Yeah, we're with...

279
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,860
我们是和杰夫·鲍曼一起的
We're with Jeff Bauman.

280
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,920
在这里，我们是他的家人
Right here. We're his family.

281
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,140
鲍曼夫妇？
Mr. and Mrs. Bauman?

282
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,240
- 在的  - 嗯
- Yeah. - Mmm. Yes.

283
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,910
我是卡利什医生
I'm Dr. Kalish.

284
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,910
杰夫还活着
Jeff's alive.

285
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,740
你们的儿子还活着
Your son's alive.

286
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,300
太好了
Yeah. All right.

287
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,710
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

288
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,390
杰夫送来的时候，双腿上绑着止血带以免大量出血
So, Jeff came in bleeding with tourniquets on both legs,

289
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,920
他被立即气管插管
and he was intubated right away

290
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,420
然后马上
and then brought up immediately

291
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,160
送到了手术室
to the operating room.

292
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:52,940
嗨
Hi.

293
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,270
我在找杰夫·鲍曼
I'm looking for Jeff Bauman.

294
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,980
额，你在这登记一下
Um, you're gonna have to sign in here.

295
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,240
写上他的名字，我们会帮你找到他的
Put his name here and we'll find out where he is.

296
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,450
你能告诉我他是在这所医院吗？
Um, can you tell me if he's at this hospital, please?

297
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,470
这个...这个我做不到
I... I can't tell you.

298
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,940
我看到了照片，我知道他被送到了医院
I saw a picture.I know he's at a hospital.

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
- 但我不知道是哪一家           - 请你去等候室稍等下
- I just don't know which one. - Please go to the waiting room

300
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,040
找到他了我会去那找你
and I'll get you in here.

301
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,000
你能直接告诉我他在哪一层吗？
Can you please just tell me what floor he's on?

302
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,960
现在情况有点复杂，但我会帮你的
It's crazy right now.I will help you.

303
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,340
杰夫接受了
Jeff underwent a double

304
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,180
膝盖以下的截肢手术
above-the-knee amputation.

305
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,150
实际上大部分膝盖以下的损伤都是
Most of the destruction had actually already been done

306
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,950
由炸弹造成的
by the bomb below the knees,

307
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,420
这对于所有的外科医生来说都是很明显的结果
and it was very obvious to all the surgeons involved

308
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,350
已经没有任何办法去挽救
that there was no way to salvage anything

309
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,160
他膝盖以下的部位了
below the knee.

310
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,230
我们为了保住膝盖以上的部位不得不清洁皮肤
We had to get higher than the knee to get clean skin,

311
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,260
清洁肌肉、清洁组织
clean muscle, clean tissue.

312
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,740
哦，天啊
Oh, my God.

313
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,900
我要喝点东西
I gotta get something to drink.

314
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,300
额，要给你拿点可乐
Um, do you want me to get you a Coke,

315
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,890
或者薯片，还是其他东西？
or chips, or something?

316
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,330
他们仔细检查所有这些残片后
As they look through all these little pieces,

317
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,070
布瑞恩，他们认为炸弹
Brian, they think the bomb now

318
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,870
是通过将组件
was made by putting the components

319
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,970
放入高压锅中制造出来的
inside a pressure cooker pot.

320
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,470
里面还有钉子、铅笔和钢珠
And in there were nails,BBs and ball bearings

321
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,880
来增加爆炸造成的
to magnify the destructive

322
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,380
破坏性和伤害性
and injury-causing nature of the blast.

323
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,950
主要的爆炸物是火药
And the explosive was gunpowder.

324
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,310
有人问我
Some guy asked me

325
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,500
我的儿子是不是还在昏迷，我就聊了聊
if my son is still unconscious while I'm takin' a leak,

326
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,700
难道我应该知道
and I'm supposed to know

327
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,010
这人他妈的是位记者吗？
this freak is a fuckin' reporter?

328
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,230
你一定也不起疑吗？当一个陌生人
It ain't suspicious to ya?A stranger chattin' it up

329
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,240
在你手中拿着鸡巴的时候突然和你聊天？
while you got your dick in your hand?

330
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,030
珍妮，我当时是在洗手
Jenny, I was washin' my hands.

331
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,630
闭嘴！你他妈的在大喊大叫，杰夫！
Shut the fuck up! You're fucking yelling about,Jeff!

332
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,840
啊，天啊...
Ah, Jesus...

333
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,990
别再提她的儿子了！
Stop talking about her son!

334
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,140
他也是我的儿子
He's my son, too.

335
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,120
- 是她的儿子 - 闭嘴
- It's hers. - Shut up.

336
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,990
你想要做什么？
What do you want?

337
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,090
抱歉打扰了
I'm so sorry to intrude.

338
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,980
你也是记者，是吗？
You're another reporter, aren't you?

339
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,170
别让他进来，杰夫
Don't let him in, Jeff.

340
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,720
不好意思，我，我找帕蒂·乔伊斯
I'm sorry, I'm, um,looking for Patty Joyce.

341
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,820
我就是
I'm Patty.

342
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,800
你没听见我们说的吗？
Did you not hear us?

343
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,170
我是凯文·霍斯特，额...
I'm Kevin Horst. Uh...

344
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:46,660
谁？
Who?

345
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,820
我是杰夫在好市多的经理
I'm Jeff's manager at Costco.

346
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,120
检查下他的身份
Check his ID.

347
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,370
那些记者会想尽一切办法
These reporters will try everything.

348
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,890
想起来了，你是...你是卡尔，对吧？
Yeah, yeah, yeah.You're... You're Carl, right?

349
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,480
杰夫说起过你
Yeah, Jeff talks about ya.

350
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,350
你也知道发生的事了，不是吗？
Well, ya heard what happened, huh?

351
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,840
是的
Yeah.

352
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,550
你知道我们的儿子失去了他的腿，对吗？
You know our son lost his legs, right?

353
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,580
我知道
I know.

354
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,860
你还带来了早餐？
And you brought breakfast?

355
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,180
- 这毫无帮助          - 非常感谢
- That's not helpful. - Uh, thank you very much.

356
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,670
我们或许等会儿再进餐
Maybe we should wait to eat 'em

357
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,060
然后你就可以拿出你的相机
so you can go grab your camera.

358
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,600
拍几张照片给你的好市多时事通讯
Take a picture for your Costco newsletter.

359
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,220
我...真的，我很乐意帮你想要带的东西
I'm... Really, I'm happy to bring whatever you like.

360
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,360
你能给我们什么
What could you possibly get us

361
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,600
现在所需要的东西，凯文？
that we need right now, Kevin?

362
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,980
嗯, 我打印了...
Well, I took the liberty of printing up...

363
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,060
这简直他妈的就是个笑话，你是在逗我吧你？
A fucking joke.You kiddin' me?

364
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,440
...他的保险单，我把主要内容标记出来了
...his policy and I've highlighted the areas

365
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,730
需要你签个字
that you'll need to sign.

366
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,710
在没律师的情况下什么也别签！
Don't sign nothin' without a goddamn lawyer!

367
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,430
能让他把话说完吗？
Can you just let him talk for a second?

368
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,310
你又是哪位？
Who are you again?

369
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,990
没错，闭上你的嘴，让他继续说
Yeah, shut the fuck up and let him talk.

370
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,090
他要说的话有什么值得
What's he gonna say that we need

371
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,150
- 我们现在就得听的？ - 我不知道
- to hear right now? - I don't know.

372
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,380
好的，你先回答我这个，你先回答我这个
Okay, answer me this.Answer me this.

373
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,920
当我的儿子度过这个坎儿，他将到哪里去工作，凯文？
My son makes it through this,where's he gonna work, Kevin?

374
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,780
他将到哪里去工作？
Where's he gonna work?

375
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,150
嗯？你会重新雇佣他吗？
Hmm? You gonna hire him back?

376
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,450
我的天啊，我们现在就得说这个吗？
Jesus Christ.We need this right now?

377
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,190
没错，现在就得说！
Yes, we do!

378
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,160
他没了腿谁会雇他，帕蒂？
Who's gonna hire him without any legs, Patty?

379
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,930
我们不会重新雇佣他，先生
We can't rehire him, sir.

380
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,160
看见没？我早就说了
See? I told ya.

381
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,500
鲍曼先生，请让我说完
Mr. Bauman, please,let me finish.

382
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,960
我们不会重新雇佣他
We can't rehire him,

383
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,030
因为他永远不会停止为我们工作
'cause he'll never have stopped working for us.

384
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,870
我们不会解雇他的
We're not letting Jeff go.

385
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,910
这个...这太傻了，但这只是...
And these... This is stupid.But this is just...

386
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,540
你知道，这只是为了
You know, this is just to get the insurance goin'

387
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,940
让保险的进程能够顺利进行
and get that rollin'.

388
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,110
等下，保险？
Wait, insurance?

389
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,950
是的
Yes.

390
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,610
杰夫瑞有保险？
Jeffrey has insurance?

391
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,920
当然，当然，额...
Of course, of course. Um...

392
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,090
为杰夫或任何家庭成员
Plus legal, mental health,or financial advice

393
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,530
提供法律、心理健康或财务建议
for Jeff or any member of the family.

394
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,220
我也把我的私人电话
And I've included my personal cell

395
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,150
写在最上面了，额...
at the top there. Um...

396
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,080
好的，很好
All right, good.

397
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,070
非常好，很高兴你们在做正确的事
Good, I'm glad you guys are doin' the right thing.

398
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,780
那么，我们拿到了什么味的松饼？
So, what kinda muffins we got there?

399
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,150
所有这些事情
All of those things happened

400
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,720
都是为这样事件做准备的
in preparation for this event.

401
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,080
但没有任何意向
But there was no specific intelligence

402
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
表明会发生的事
that anything was going to happen.

403
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,620
在这个时间点谈细节
At this point in time,it's too early

404
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,750
还为时尚早
to get into the specifics.

405
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,050
那是强有力的装置
These were powerful devices

406
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,090
并造成了严重的伤害
that resulted in serious injuries.

407
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,630
你们现在有监禁什么人吗？
Do you have someone in custody?

408
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,760
那些报道都不是真的
Those reports are not true.

409
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,270
目前还没有任何的嫌疑犯被监禁
There is no suspect in custody.

410
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,560
民众都有很多的疑问
We're questioning many people,

411
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,970
但是目前没有任何一个人被监禁
but there is no one in custody at this point in time.

412
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,710
杰夫？
Jeff?

413
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,080
我去，你是醒了吗，兄弟？
Holy shit. Are you awake, bro?

414
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
能听到我吗？
You hear me?

415
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,620
好的，好的，好的
Okay. Okay, okay.

416
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,990
额，我得和你说下，发生了一场爆炸
Uh, so I gotta tell ya,there was an explosion.

417
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,160
你的腿...
And your fuckin' legs...

418
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,680
它们没了，兄弟
They're gone, bro.

419
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,120
你在做什么？
What are you doin', buddy?

420
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,320
我不明白你手指说的
I can't tell what your fingers are doin'.

421
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,090
什么，你是要写东西是吗？
What, you wanna write somethin'?

422
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,890
等下
Hold on.

423
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,830
给，给你笔
Here, buddy, here.Here's a pen.

424
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,940
抓住了
Yeah, grab that.

425
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,890
艾琳没事吧？

426
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,280
艾琳？艾琳，她没事，她也在这，她...
Erin? Erin, yeah, she's fine,she's here. She's...

427
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,710
我们全家都在这，他们都在走廊
The whole family's here.Everyone's down the hall.

428
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,890
你还好吗？感觉怎么样？
You okay? How you feelin'?

429
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,920
“丹中尉”
"Lieutenant Dan"?

430
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,340
你是说《阿甘正传》里没有腿的那位？
You mean the guy from Forrest Gump with no legs?

431
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,050
哦，我天，别动
Oh, shit. Don't move.

432
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,960
鲍勃，鲍勃，醒醒！
Bob, Bob, wake up!

433
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,260
怎么了，小德？
What the hell, D?

434
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,570
- 杰夫醒了      - 啊？
- Jeff's awake. - Huh?

435
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,610
他写了这个
He wrote this.

436
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,950
看到爆炸凶犯了

437
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,710
最下面这个
The last part.

438
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,960
我的天啊
Holy shit.

439
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,430
怎么了？小德？
What happened? D?

440
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,000
他醒了
He's awake.

441
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
FBI办公室在哪？
Where's the FBI office?

442
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,320
鲍勃
Bob.

443
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,070
嘿！
Hey!

444

00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,210
杰夫
Jeffie.

450
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,870
安静，这只是...
Cut it down, guys.This is just...

451
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,630
杰夫瑞？嘿，宝贝
Jeffrey? Hey, baby.

452
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,010
哦，我的天啊，我们太高兴你终于醒过来了
Oh, my God, we are so happy you're back with us.

453
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,450
额...听着
Uh... Um, now listen,

454
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,250
等会儿会有些FBI的人进来
some of the FBI guys are gonna come in.

455
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,920
他们会问你，额...问你一些问题
They're gonna ask ya,y'know, a... A few questions.

456
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,390
可以吗？
So... Okay?

457
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,790
你得如实告诉他们你看到的
And all ya gotta do is just tell 'em what ya saw.

458
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,060
很好
That's great.

459
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,160
我们得拔气管插管了
We're removing the intubation tube.

460
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,900
请大家都出去
We need everyone to clear out.

461
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,030
但我们刚刚...
But we just got...

462
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,430
我们等会儿过来
We'll be back.

463
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,900
我们要准备把呼吸插管拔出来了
We're just getting ready to take the breathing tube out.

464
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,930
- 没事的         - 等会儿见
- It'll be okay. - See ya later.

465
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,870
走吧，我们走吧
Let's go. Let's go.

466
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,910
我们要拔管了，好吗？
We gotta get that tube out, okay?

467
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,450
准备好了吗？
You ready, buddy?

468
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,410
怎么了？你想她留下？
What's wrong, bud?You want her?

469
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,920
好的，我让她留下，好的
Yeah. I'mma let her stay.It's okay.

470
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,050
好的，你会没事的
It's okay.You're all right, buddy.

471
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,490
放轻松，好吗？
Relax, okay?

472
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,960
好吧，在我们拿出这个管子之前
All right, we have a couple minutes of hubbub

473
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
可能会有点吵
before we get the tube out.

474
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,190
张嘴，我们先清理下你的嘴部
Open your mouth. We just gonna clean your mouth first.

475
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,030
然后我们就把管子拔出来
Then we're gonna get that tube out.

476
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,090
放松，让我把这些胶带拿掉，很好
Relax. Lemme just take off some tape. Perfect.

477
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,950
- 慢慢呼吸      - 调整下链扣
- Slow breaths. - We have a cuff link.

478
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,230
开始了，准备好没？
Here we go, bud. Ready?

479
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,200
一、二、三，深吸一口气
One, two, three.Take a big breath.

480
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,370
深呼吸，深呼吸
Big breath, big breath.

481
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,490
深呼吸
Big breath.

482
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,460
大口呼吸
Take a big breath.

483
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,630
好的，放松，放松
Okay. Relax, relax.

484
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,810
慢慢呼吸，她给你再次清理一下嘴部
Slow breaths. She's just gonna suction your mouth again.

485
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,140
慢慢呼吸
Slow breaths, bud.

486
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,520
很棒，能试着说一下“嗨”吗？
Good job. Can you say "Hi"?

487
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,950
嗨
Hi.

488
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,860
好的，非常好，非常好
Okay, good job, good job.

489
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,990
我们帮你把这个呼吸罩戴上
We're gonna put this mask on.

490
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,190
把它戴上，放松
Put that on. Relax.

491
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,930
好的，你可以和他说话了
All right.You can talk to him,

492
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,260
但他不一定可以回答，好吗？
but he can't answer you, okay?

493
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,150
- 好的  - 点头摇头
- Okay. - Yes and no.

494
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,070
感觉怎么样？好的，小伙
Okay? All right, buddy.

495
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,560
- 你很棒，很棒          - 你们聊，孩子
- Great job, great job. - Good to go, kid.

496
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,240
嘿，小艾
Hey, E.

497
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,020
嗯？
Mmm?

498
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,840
你坐到我的腿上了
You're sittin' on my leg.

499
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,020
噢
Oh.

500
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,570
嗨
Hi.

501
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,480
嗨
Hi.

502
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,430
别说话，别说话
No talking. No talking.

503
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,270
我是硬汉
I'm a tough guy.

504
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,570
别说话
No talking.

505
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,910
我知道你是硬汉
I know you're tough.

506
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,740
他是要告诉他们关于炸弹的事吗？
Is he in there tellin' 'em about the bomber?

507
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,670
我想是吧
Yeah, I think so.

508
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,520
真他妈是个奇迹，我的儿子他妈的是个英雄
Fuckin' miracle.My boy. Fuckin' hero.

509
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,080
你说得对
You bet.

510
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,970
可以说是体格有点大
Sorta the same kinda build,

511
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,430
但是，或许更高点
but, like,maybe a little taller.

512
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,190
但我看着他的眼睛
But I looked him right in the eyes,

513
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,860
没感觉有什么问题...
so he's the same...

514
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,270
他是年轻人还是有点老？
Was he young or old?

515
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,920
额，他是年轻人
Yeah, he was young.

516
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,980
嗯
Yeah.

517
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,600
爆炸后你还记得什么？
What do you remember after the blast?

518
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,180
额...
Uh...

519
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,100
那里，额，那种味道
There was, like, this smell.

520
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,290
闻起来有点像...
Like, it smelled like...

521
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
慢慢来
Take your time.

522
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
有点像是独立纪念日
Like the Fourth of July.

523
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,570
...事实上
...in fact,

524
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,070
好的，舍恩菲尔德博士
All right Dr. Schoenfeld,

525
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,200
很高兴你和我们一起
thank you so much for joining us.

526
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,470
我们很感谢
We really appreciate it.

527
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,470
显然，舍恩菲尔德博士，根据他说的情况
Obviously, Dr. Schoenfeld,limited by what he can say

528
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,340
显而易见，这次追捕将是巨大的
because of the situation,obviously,

529
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,980
也是被全球瞩目的
this huge manhunt being watched worldwide.

530
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,510
头号嫌疑人
An individual, Suspect Number 1,

531
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,350
现在也已经确认死亡
now dead, we know.

532
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,160
太他妈的棒了！
Fuckin' A!

533
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,070
- 哦，我的天啊！ - 狗日的！
- Oh, my God!    - You son of a bitch!

534
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,050
把另一个狗日的也杀了吧！
Kill that other son of a bitch, too!

535
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,370
杰夫瑞，我刚刚见过卡洛斯
Jeffrey, I just met Carlos.

536
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,540
他就是救了你的命的那个人
He's the guy who saved your life.

537
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,710
你要点咖啡吗？
Would you like a coffee?

538
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,150
我带了些...我有些咖啡
I brought some...I've got some coffees.

539
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,830
我不知道我该怎么做
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.

540
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,630
我想现在在医院的这些人
I think everyone in that hospital

541
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,630
都在想这个同样的问题
is thinking that same thing.

542
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,920
嗯
Yeah.

543
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,440
我们和杰夫在一个月前分手了
We broke up about a month ago, me and Jeff.

544
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,670
不是第一次
It's not the first time,

545
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,180
但我们后来总能复合
ut we usually get back together.

546
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,350
这次没有吗？
Not this time?

547
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,040
他从不为任何事露面
Doesn't show up for anything.

548
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,480
他总是迟到
He's always late.

549
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,090
你知道，他...他从没想过要离开他的公寓
You know, he... He never wants to leave his apartment.

550
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,310
我受够了
I'm just fed up with it.

551
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,570
但这次他居然露面了
And then he shows up.

552
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,080
听起来像是多次的突击步枪射击声
Sounded like multiple assault rifle shots to me.

553
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
晚上8点15分，有个人被困在了
8:15 p.m.A person is cornered

554
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,520
沃特敦的一户人家庭院的小船里
on a boat in a yard in Watertown.

555
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,140
马拉松赛幸存者确认嫌疑人身份
爆炸案受害者在医院给FBI提供了线索

556
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,150
船里的是另一个嫌疑犯
A suspect in the boat.

557
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,520
好几百个警察...
Hundreds of law enforcement...

558
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,720
嗨
Hi.

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,460
杰夫，你好吗？
Jeff, how you doin'?

560
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,720
那么，杰夫，我们今天得给你
So, Jeff, we have to do

561
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,160
第一次换药
the first dressing change today.

562
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,090
我们会把绷带拆掉
Okay, we're gonna take these bandages off.

563
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,330
我不看
I'm not looking.

564
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,140
感觉很糟的话，请告诉我们
Things get too rough, please let us know

565
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,150
我们会想办法帮你
and we can figure out how to help you.

566
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,570
打扰了？
I'm sorry?

567
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,130
你早先已经给他
And did you already pre-medicate him

568
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,440
- 做好换药准备了吗？       - 是的
- for the dressing change? - Yep.

569
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,140
他已经输了氧和打了吗啡
He's already gotten his oxy and his dilaudid PO.

570
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,250
他现在需要芬太尼撑一下
He has a PR in fentanyl for breakthrough.

571
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,680
我的口袋里正好有很多
And I have plenty in my pocket.

572
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,030
有的人喜欢看着
Now some people like to look.

573
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,330
有的人一点也不喜欢
Some people don't like to look at all.

574
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:16,900
我不喜欢
No.

575
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,550
我现在不想看
I don't wanna look at me now.

576
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,290
那么，玛丽恩，举起右腿...
So, Marion, if you can hold up the right leg...

577
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,560
- 好的  - ...那将有很大帮助
- Okay. - ...that would be very helpful

578
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,820
现在我们会拆开他们
and we'll unwrap 'em now.

579
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,260
好的，我要把你抬起来
All righty.I'm gonna just lift ya up.

580
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,390
你会感觉到我的手
You're gonna feel my hands.

581
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,550
对不起
I'm sorry, hon.

582
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,700
现在我要开始拆绷带
So I'm just taking the tape off

583
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,570
我会先打开第一层绷带
and I'm gonna unwrap the Ace bandage first.

584
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,500
这应该不会没什么问题
This shouldn't be too bad.

585
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,440
但如果你痛的话或是其他的
But if you have any sharp pains or anything,

586
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,950
请告诉我们

587
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,350
好的，你将会感觉到我的手
All right,you're gonna feel my hands.

588
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,880
准备好了就告诉我，准备好了吗？
Tell me if you're ready.Did that kick in yet?

589
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,680

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,680
准备好了
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,580
好的
All right.

592
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,790
纱布要拆完了
Almost done with the gauze.

593
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,270
妈的
Fuck.

594
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,820
还好吗？
You okay?

595
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,730
没事
Yeah.

596
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,980
如果你需要休息一下请告诉我们，好吗？
You let us know if you need a break, okay?

597
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,530
你没事的
You're okay.

598
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,870
别看它们
Don't look at 'em.

599
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,600
我没在看它们，我在看你
I'm not lookin' at 'em.Lookin' at you.

600
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,610
好的，现在的话可能会有点刺痛
Okay, now this might be a little sticky.

601
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,360
妈啊！
God!

602
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,860
很好，很好

你做的很棒

好的，绷带拆下了，我们让你休息一下
Okay, the dressing's off.We'll give you a minute.

605
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,250
呼吸一下
Nice little breaths.

606
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,400
很好
Good job.

607
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,490
鼻子吸进去，嘴巴呼出来
In your nose, out your mouth.

608
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,690
你做的非常好
You're doing so great.

609
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,760
这是最难的
That was the worst.

610
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,480
拆绷带是最难的部分
Getting the dressings off is the worst.

611
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,040
想要点芬太尼吗？
Want a little more fentanyl?

612
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,270
好的
Okay.

613
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,690
接下来你马上
'Cause now we're gonna

614
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,210
要拆除左腿的绷带了，好吗？

615
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,030
好的
Yeah.

616
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,220
你介意去那边吗，玛丽恩？
You mind going over there, Marion?

617
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,970
我们就要开始了
We're just gonna set up.

618
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,140
我们现在什么都还没有碰
We're not touching anything yet.

619
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,250
才刚刚开始
We're just settin' up.

620
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,100
稍微往下一点
Just gonna shimmy this down a little.

621
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,710
好的，很好，我要抬起来了，一、二、三
Okay. All right, I'm gonna lift up, one, two, three.

622
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,850
你会再次有同样的感觉的
You're gonna feel this again.

623
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,350
和拆刚刚另外一条腿的绷带感觉差不多
Pretty much just like the other one.

624
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,750
妈的！
Cock!

625
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,750
抱歉
Sorry, hon.

626
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,660
你没事的
You're okay.

627
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,150
我口袋里有芬太尼
I have the fentanyl in my pocket.

628
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,520
你想要我现在就给你些吗？
Do you want me to give you that?

629
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,190
是的是的，给他一些
Yeah, yeah.Let's give that to him.

630
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,660
好的，我们休息一下
All right,we're gonna take a break.

631
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,890
我们会给你一些药
We'll give you some more medicine.

632
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,260
好的，让我给...
Okay, let me just get to...

633
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,460
我只是要解决你的问题
I'm just gonna work around you,

634
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,500
所以我要给你静脉注射
so I'm just gonna get to my IV.

635
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,600
我们快要弄完了
We're almost done.

636
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,440
好的，同样的，会有点刺痛

639
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,680

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,490
是的
Yeah.

644

睡了两个小时
A good two hours.

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
你需要理个发

00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,730
- 是吗？   - 嗯

你还要洗个头

- 不要 - 要的
- No.  - Yes.

650
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,620
闻起来依旧有....
Still smells like...

651
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,010
你得看看我为你写的标语
You should have seen the sign I made for ya.

652
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,230
写的什么？

653
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,610
就是，3D字体啊，还有些其他的

太棒了！太棒了！

663
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,790
怎么了？
What's that?

664
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,930
我不知道
I don't know.

665
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,980
或许他们抓到另一个凶手了
Maybe they caught the other guy.

666
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,760
拜，杰夫，我们为你骄傲

667
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,060

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,610
...一小时前
...hours ago

669
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,820
看起来一切都结束了
now seems to be finally over.

670
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,890
警方正在搜查的最后一名嫌疑犯...

据波士顿警察局...

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,930
我想...我想他想要自己来

674
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,090
好的
Yeah, okay.

675
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,920

要回家了是不是很开心？

682
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,880
卡洛斯·阿雷东多
Is Carlos Arrendondo

683
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,730
是你的救命恩人吗？
your guardian angel?

684
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,040
他们讨厌对方
They hated each other

685
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,540
这就是为什么皮特被逮住了
and that's why Pete got busted for it.

686
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,320
因为鲍勃用了他的电脑

687
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,260
然而皮特没有出卖他
And Pete didn't rat him out.

688
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,380
他...他差点因为这个进了监狱
And he... He almost had to go to jail for that.

689
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,150
这都写在报纸上
It was in the papers and all that.

690

嘿，听着，快看

00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,580
- 哦，我的... - 两边都有
- Oh, my...   - Both sides.

694

“波士顿坚强”
"Boston Strong."

695
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,960
让...我们得挥挥手
Let... We gotta wave.

696
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,860
这到底意味着什么？
What does that even mean?

697
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,330
挥手
Wave.

698
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,090
你是平民
You're a national

你是个真实的英雄
You're a real hero.

703

不是吗？
Isn't that somethin'?

704
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,760
而这还只是开始
And it's just the start.

705
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,000
这真的很有意义
That's really somethin'.

706
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,700
我是个站在那里
I'm a hero for standin' there

707
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,570
然后把腿给炸掉的英雄吗？

708
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,040
你到底在说什么？
Yeah, what are ya talkin' about?

That's the HOV for electric vehicles and whatnot.

710
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,580

No, it... Like for, uh,just for handicap cars.

711
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,450
不，不，没有残障人士车道
No, no, there's no handicap drivin' lanes.

712
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,980
天啊，真是一群白痴
Jesus, what a bunch of morons.

713
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,620
好的，我们他妈的是白痴
Okay, we're fuckin' morons,

714
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,020
就因为我们关心残疾人？
'cause we care about people with disabilities?

715
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,090
哦，哦，杰夫，杰夫！他到了
Oh, oh,Jeff, Jeff! He's here.

哦，该死，别推
Oh, shit, don't pull it.

00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,170
好的，可以了吗？

能后退点吗？喔-喔-喔！
Got the back?Whoo-hoo-hoo!

725
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,040
帕蒂，我依旧觉得杰夫应该和我一起住
Patty, I still think Jeffie could live with me.

726
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,940

Oh, yeah, all the way up there in Cow-Hampshire.

727

他的所有朋友都在这，你个傻逼
All his friends are here,ya idiot.

728
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,570
恕我直言，我的房间比你的多
All due respect, I got more room than all of yas.

729
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,950
我是唯一一个信用评分超过520分的人
And I'm the only one with a credit score above 520.

730
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,150
我还有个游泳池
I'm the one got a pool.

731
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,780
在他妈的地面上！

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,690
哦，小心，小心
Oh, careful, careful.

733
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,820
嗷！

我的老天爷啊！
For God's sakes!

735
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,890
天啊！我的小腿
Jesus! My shin splints.

736

天啊，你得找个有斜坡
God. You're gonna have to get

737
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,700
或是有电梯的地方
a place with a ramp or an elevator.

738
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,830
我们最终他妈的有一天也会坐在轮椅上
We're all gonna end up in a fuckin' wheelchair.

739
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,670
试着轻点放
Just tryin' to take it real lightly.

740
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,800
他回家了！这才是最重要的
He's home!That's all that matters.

741

天啊，我有好多的事要做...

哦，我的天，我以为会比这好的多
Oh, my God, I thought it was gonna be better than this.

Oh, my God, it's a little crazy at the moment,

00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,990
你认为发生了什么事？
What do you think is going on?

834
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,220
天啊，帕蒂，你觉得当男孩把自己门锁上了
Jesus, Patty, what do you think boys do in their room

835
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,060
是在做什么？
when they lock their door?

836
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,960
- 好吧，我觉得他就在做那个     - 你觉得他...
- Yeah, I think he's doin' it. - You think he...

837
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,600
这孩子没腿而且如牛负重
The kid's got no legs and he's blowin' loads.

838
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,430
你很污啊...
Dirty fucking...

839
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,530
杰夫瑞？

将会是很特别的一天，杰夫

843
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,910
我只希望你可以
I just wish you would have

844
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,150
让人剪了你那该死的头发
let somebody cut your freakin' hair.

845
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,480
哦，别再挑剔他了
Oh, stop pickin' on him.

846
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,080
会没事的

847
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,150

嗨，他做得很棒

他有个预约，所以...

00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,260
我是他的阿姨珍妮，我是来打气的

852
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,630
在波士顿马拉松比赛
After the bomb blast

853
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,100
炸弹爆炸后他失去了大部分腿

854
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,030
28岁的切姆斯福德居民
28-year-old Chelmsford resident

855
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,130
杰夫·鲍曼是幸运的
Jeff Bauman is lucky to be alive,

856
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,600
但他的真正斗争才刚刚开始

鲍曼告诉记者, 他总有一天会再次走路

858
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,280
经过多次手术

859
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,340
和无尽的痛苦康复治疗
and endless painful rehabilitation,

860
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,140
许多人可能会选择放弃

861
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,550
- 艾琳，这里！     - 但是在他的家人

865
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,050
杰夫·鲍曼在斯波尔丁医院
Jeff Bauman has found something amazing

866
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,290
找到了一件特别的东西

867
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,490
那个东西叫做希望
That something is called hope.

868
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,630
在马拉松爆炸之后的日子里
In the days following the Marathon bombing,

869
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:23,230
这张照片显示了在终点线的大屠杀
this photograph showed the carnage at the finish line.

870
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,660
杰夫·鲍曼当时站在一个炸弹旁边
Jeff Bauman was standing next to one of the bombs

871
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,530
它引爆之后，他的腿受到了巨大的损伤
when it detonated,obliterating his legs.

872
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,400
一天之后，在他的病床上

873
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,070
鲍曼草草地写下笔记

“我知道发生了什么”

875
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,170
我的儿子，他是个真正的英雄
He's a real hero, my son.

876
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,200
他在帮助这个城市治愈

877
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,610
成为波士顿坚强

878
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,010
这是真的吗，杰夫？
Is that true, Jeff?

879
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,190
你是波士顿坚强吗？
Are you Boston Strong?

880
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,460
你今天表现很棒，孩子
You did real good today, kiddo.

881
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,030
那种曝光，你知道吗...
That kind of exposure,you know...

882
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,200
这可能会带来机会
That could lead to opportunities.

883
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,440
给很多事带来机会，你知道吗
Make things, you know,

884
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,280
对你来说也很容易...

885
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,890
- 是的  - ...完全地
- Yeah. - ...down the line.

886
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,480
你得给卡洛斯打电话
You got a call from Carlos.

887

他想见你

而且我们也得好好谢谢他

889
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,290
在这，嘿

890
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,480
先生，你好
Sir, how you doin'?

891

- 你好，保罗         - 很高兴见到你
- How are you, Paul? - Nice to meet you.

893
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,390
额，浇铸大概要超过...
Uh, casts shouldn't take more than...

894
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,720
- 一个，一个半小时       - 好的
- Hour, hour and a half. - Okay.

895
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,090
浇铸的过程很快的
Cast is a very quick procedure,

896
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,030
但也是最重要的一部分
but it's the most important part.

897
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,100
如果我们能给你留下好印象
If we get a good impression of you,

898
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,270
那么剩下的程序就会很顺利
then the rest of the procedure is gonna go nicely.

899
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,770
- 你还好吗？ - 很好
- You okay?  - Yeah.

900
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,640
我们先从这一边开始，可以吗？
We're gonna start on this side, okay?

901
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,510
我们要在你这里套上袜子
We're gonna slip a sock on you here.

902
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,540
是个棉袜...
It's just a cotton stocking that...

903
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,110
当我们把东西包涂你身上的时候
This is so that when we wrap the plaster on you,

904
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,380
就不会直接粘在你的皮肤上
it doesn't stick directly to your skin.

905
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,750
你听过吗？
D'you hear the one

906
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,720
有个农夫在画他的浴室
where the farmer was paintin' his bathroom?

907
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,300
他想给马桶座涂上虫漆
Figured he'd shellac the toilet seat,

908
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,220
让它看起来更漂亮，他没有告诉他妻子
make it look prettier.He didn't tell his wife.

909
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,590
他女儿说“怎么了, 爸爸？
Daughter says,"What's the matter, Dad?

910
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,270
你以前没见过这些吗？”
Ain't you ever seen one of these before?"

911
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,390
他说“是的，我从来没见过有人把它框起来”
He says, "Yeah, I just never saw anybody frame it."

912
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,130
对不起，对不起，对不起，杰夫
Sorry, sorry.Sorry, Jeff.

913
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,440
别让他笑得太厉害
Don't make him laugh too hard.

914
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,770
...不然这个会变得困难
...allow this to get hard.

915
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,280
然后我们要在里面做个切片
And then we're gonna make a slice in it.

916
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,610
我们马上就把它卸下，好吗？
We're gonna take it right off you, okay?

917
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,580
也许你可以，额，用你的新腿
Maybe you could, uh,use your new legs

918
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,050
出现在下周棕熊队的比赛，不是吗？
for next week at the Bruins game, huh?

919
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,550
妈，那是，还有一周

00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,420
滚吧
Get outta here.

923
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,550
几周时间，杰夫，你会站起来的
Couple of weeks, Jeff,you'll be up.

924
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,790
我等不了那么久
I can't wait.

925
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,160
我们会尽快让你站起来的
We can get you up any time.

926
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,460
我们要把这里清理下
We're gonna clean up this side

927
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,660
然后会把它做好
and then we'll go on and do the right.

928
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,090
我们会很快的...
We'll be just as quick and...

929
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,270
我都想在上面签个名了
I wanna have it signed.

930
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,700
- 尽量减少些痛苦，好吗...        - 好的
- Less pain. Okay...    - Yeah, yeah.

931
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,430
...但至少你知道该期待什么
...but at least you know what to expect.

932
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,530
对的
Right.

933
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,230
他们邀请他到冰面上去
They've asked him to go out

934
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,500
挥舞旗子
on the ice and wave the flag.

935
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,840
红袜队的乔尼·戈麦斯
Jonny Gomes coming to the plate here

936
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,240
- 来到这里的板子   - 加油，乔尼！

现在是一对一
Be one to one now.

939
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,780
别乱摇那鬼东西，顺其自然
Don't swing at that shit.Let that shit go.

940
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,580
戈麦斯手里拿着一个特别的棒球棒
Gomes with a special bat in hand,

941
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,080
那是为了纪念

942
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,210
波士顿坚强

不太好，是吗？
Not too good, huh?

950

他搞砸了
No, he fouled up.

951
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,330
在我们经历过的一切之后？
After everything we've been through?

952
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,630
我们受的苦还不够吗？

嘿，所以他会去吗？

他紧张个什么？

956
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,640
杰夫，我们听说了棕熊队比赛的事了！

985
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,460
他们邀请我去然后出现在冰上
and they asked me to come out there on the ice.

986
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,960
冰上？
On the ice?

990
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,600
对于那些喜欢唱歌的人来说
It's kind of like singin' the national anthem,

991
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,980
有点儿像唱国歌那种
but for people who suck at singing.

992
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,240
你确定你要这么做？
You sure you wanna do that?

993
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,260
大家都说我应该这么做，而且是史丹利杯赛，所以...
Well, everybody says I should.It's the Stanley Cup, so...

我不想没有你在的情况下做这件事
I don't think that I could do it without you.

999

我知道我说的话不太合理
And I know that it's not really fair of me to say.

01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,300
如果你愿意听我的话...
If you would listen to me...

1232
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:06,970
不，你没资格代替我儿子说话
No, you don't speak for my son.

1233
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,860
你为什么...为什么不早点告诉我？
Why'd you... Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1234
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,950
什么？
What?

1235
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:17,620
你为什么不早点告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1236
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,350
你觉得呢？我想要有个惊喜
Why do you think? I wanted to make it a surprise.

1237
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,420
它是个重大消息，知道吗？
I wanted a big announcement.You know?

1238
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,560
那可是奥普拉·温弗瑞
It's Oprah Winfrey.

1239
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,460
对不起，妈
I'm sorry, Ma.

1240
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,150
如果没有奥普拉, 我都不知道在哪？
Where would I have been without Oprah?

1241
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,100
她帮我度过了一段难熬的时期
She got me through the bad times.

1242
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:33,830
否则我不知道会在哪里，会是什么
And I don't know where,what I would be.

1243
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,000
我会...我会吊死自己
I would've...I would've hung myself

1244
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,840
在浴室里，如果没有奥普拉的帮助
in the bathroom without Oprah.

1245
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,710
只是说说而已
Just sayin'.

1246
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,450
只是说说而已
Just sayin'.

1247
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,900
嘿，如果奥普拉是你的生命线
So, hey,if Oprah's your lifeline,

1248
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,490
那你有很多更深层次的问题，帕蒂
you got a lot deeper issues, Patty.

1249
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,330
- 我只是说说而已 - 去你的，鲍勃
- I'm just sayin'. - Fuck you, Bob.

1250
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,830
闭嘴，鲍勃
Shut up, Bob.

1251
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,760
我只是想让人看到我的儿子是多么的棒
I just wanted people to see how amazing my son is.

1252
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,500
仅此而已
That's all.

1253
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:04,710
那有什么不对的吗？
What's so bad about that?

1254
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,460
啊，小艾，别这样
Aw, E, come on.

1255
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,380
抱歉
Sorry.

1256
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:25,950
- 小艾，加油，用点力   - 我在用力了
- E, come on, push it. - I am.

1257
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,210
好了
There ya go.

1258
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,580
我来
I got it.

1259
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,230

哦，嘿
Oh, hey.

1261
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,160
哦，你好吗？
Oh, how you doin'?

1262
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,170
嗯，很好，你呢？
Um, really well. How are you?

1263
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,900
萨利送了我一顶草帽
Sully bought me a fuckin' sombrero.

1264
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,170
- 我...  - 是吗？
- I'm... - He did?

1265
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,540
- 是的  - 这是他给的？
- Yeah. - This is from him?

1266
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,770
是的，他说他昨晚
Yeah, he said he was out

1267
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:46,940
在墨西哥餐馆吃饭，所以…
at a Mexican restaurant last night, so...

1268
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:51,900
他们有超级锤还带回了两顶草帽
They got super hammered and brought back two sombreros

1269
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,420
我拿了一顶
and I got one of 'em.

1270
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,920
不错
Lucky.

1271
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:05,760
- 一...  - 二，三
- One... - Two, three!

1272
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:08,950
- 哦，妈的  - 妈的
- Oh, fuck. - Fuck.

1273
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,200
你在逗我吗你？
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

1274
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,700
对不起

1291
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,660
杰夫瑞？

1292
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,930
她说的是我的儿子
She's talkin' about my son.

1293
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,930
嘿，杰夫瑞，我们应该...我们应该去科罗拉多
Hey, Jeffrey, we should go...We should go to Colorado.

1294
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,530
- 我们应该去丹佛          - 妈
- We should go to Denver. - Ma.

1295
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,800
去见这些可爱的人们

1296
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,540
我觉得我们应该去丹佛，宝贝

1297
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,780
等你好些了，我们就应该去丹佛
We should go to Denver when you're better.

1298
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,680
就你和我好吗？
Just you and me, huh?

1299
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,950
他妈的快去睡觉，妈！
Go to fuckin' sleep, Ma!

1300
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,680
哦，好的
Oh, all right.

1301
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,070
拜
Bye.

1302
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,470
我不想再听到那些信了
I don't wanna hear any more of those letters.

1303
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,350
别忘了红袜队
Don't forget about the Red Sox.

1304
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,890
他们想让你开球
Want you to throw out the first pitch.

1305
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:38,760
听着，我得走了，伙计们
Look, I gotta tap out, boys.

1306
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,100
我明早有康复治疗
I have rehab in the morning.

1307
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,560
我可不想惹女士生气
I don't want the lady gettin' pissed.

1308
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,700
想来点药吗？
Want some pills?

1309
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,970
你他妈的智障吗，萨利？
You fuckin' retarded, Sully?

1310
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,440
我刚刚和你说了，我得回家
I just told you,I gotta get home.

1311
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,700
- 那些是什么？   - 不知道
- What are they? - Not sure.

1312
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,340
在我姐姐抽屉里找到的
Found 'em on my sister's dresser.

1313
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,110
你要么会他妈的嗨起来
You're either gonna get high as fuck,

1314
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,440
或是让它们调节我们的月经
or they're gonna regulate our periods.

1315
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,380
我很肯定
Pretty sure.

1316
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,850
打扰了，你是杰夫·鲍曼吗？
Excuse me.Are you Jeff Bauman?

1317
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,480
自从我们看了那张照片之后
We have been following your story

1318
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,010
一直在跟踪你的故事
ever since we saw that photo.

1319
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:04,430
然后我们看到你在棕熊队的比赛上挥旗
Then we saw you at the Bruins game, wavin' the flag.

1320
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,020
很高兴看到你痊愈了
It's so good to see you're healed

1321
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,720
而且你没让他们赢
and that you didn't let them win.

1322
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
能合张影吗？
Can we take a picture?

1323
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:09,860
好的，当然
Yeah, sure.

1324
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,490
好的
Okay.

1325
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,630
我没让谁赢？
Who didn't I let win?

1326
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:12,630
恐怖分子
The terrorists.

1327
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,130
我们可以...好的，让我们和他合张影
Can we... Yeah, let's get a picture with him.

1328
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:17,400
哦，在这，好的
Oh, right, yeah.

1329
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,840
你确定吗？
Are you sure about that?

1330
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:19,740
是的
Yeah.

1331
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,430
我的意思是...
'Cause I mean, like...

1332
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,230
看看我坐的地方...
Where I'm sittin'...

1333
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,610
看起来他们得了一分
Y'know, looks like they at least got on the scoreboard.

1334
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,010
你知道吗？我再也走不了路了
Y'know,I'm never gonna walk again.

1335
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,640
哦！
Ooh!

1336
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,850
好的，再来一张，再来一张，再来一张
All right. One more,one more, one more.

1337
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,550
你没拍到那张照片，我就他妈的自杀
You don't get this picture,I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

1338
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,290
再来一张
Just one more.

1339
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,520
嘿，杰夫！
Hey, Jeff!

1340
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,150
愿上帝保佑你，谢谢，杰夫
God bless you.Thank you, Jeff.

1341
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,620
很高兴见到你
It was so nice to meet you.

1342
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,820
尽管如此，把你的残腿靠紧了
Keep your stumps together, though.

1343
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,960
不，用点力，给点速度！
No. Come on,give me some speed!

1344
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,030
哦，小心点，我会接着他的
Oh, watch it, I'll get him.

1345
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,490
让他飞得高点，萨尔
Get him higher, Sull.

1346
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,760
他不太清楚
He's not gonna clear it.

1347
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,500
你他妈的清醒一下你他妈的头脑！
Fuckin' clear over your fuckin' head!

1348
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,900
- 他不会他妈的让我清醒的     - 萨尔，让他飞起来
- He won't fuckin' clear me. - Sull, get him up.

1349
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,770
- 快点，让我飞起来，萨尔！  - 让他飞起来，萨尔！
- Come on, get me up, Sull! - Get him up, Sull!

1350
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:51,780
好的嘞
Here we go.

1351
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,310
用你的手臂，萨尔，使点劲！
Use your arms, Sull,use your arms!

1352
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:54,730
- 我想我要吐了            - 闭嘴！
- I think I'm gonna puke. - Shut up!

1353
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,570
- 很好！      - 请...
- It's great! - Please...

1354
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,040
- 他妈的闭上...    - 放...
- Shut the fuck... - Gets...

1355
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,410
哦，妈的！
Oh, shit!

1356
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,410
去你妈的，鲍曼
Fuck you, Bauman.

1357
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:04,810
我的啤酒洒了
I spilled my beer.

1358
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,420
看我做一个翻转
Watch me do a flip.

1359
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,990
我给它一个七分！
I give it a seven!

1360
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,690
- 七分？ - 我给它一个七分！
- Seven? - I give it a seven!

1361
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,420
等一下，等一下！
Excuse me, excuse me!

1362
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:17,830
六分吧，六分还是最大方的了
That was a six.That's a generous six.

1363
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,190
最多六分
At most.

1364
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,700
他没有他妈的坚持到着陆，兄弟
He didn't stick the fucking landing, bro.

1365

Sull, didn't you get your license yanked for driving drunk?

不，她不是我的妻子！把钥匙给我

1383
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,740
你还有驾照吗？
Do you still even got a license?

Don't arch your back.

1499
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,370
这是你这个星期的第一次训练
This is the first time you're in this week

1500
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,350
你还有另外三次的预约
and you have three appointments.

1501
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,080
好吗？
Okay?

1502
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,380
你必须尽可能多地
You gotta get in here as many times as you can

1503

- 到这里来赴约...          - 我知道

I keep tellin' 'em, y'know?

1505
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,260

...or it's not gonna work,okay?

1506

你必须遵守你的约定

你必须到这里做训练

1508
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,490
我是说，看看你的周围，杰夫
I mean, look at everybody around here, Jeff.

1509
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:52,230
他们正在恢复是因为
They're recovering because they put the time

1510
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:54,060
他们投入了大量时间和精力
and the energy into it.

1511
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,530
他们把训练作为优先事项，你也必须这样做
And they make it a priority.And you have to do that, too.

1512
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,800
找到你要的了吗？
Did you find everything?

1513
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,440

你们有洗手间吗？
Do you have a bathroom?

01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,010
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

1526
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,600
- 你想要板子          - 是的
- You want the board? - Yeah.

1527

Yeah,he'll be helpin' the Red Sox.

这是他从小时候开始就一直喜欢的队伍
It's his favorite team since he was a little boy.

1531

杰夫开球
Jeff's throwin' out the first pitch

1532
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,050
并不会帮他们赢的，帕蒂
isn't gonna help 'em win, Patty.

1533
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,150
棕熊队因为我们去了输掉了比赛
Bruins lost that game that we went to.

1534
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,650
哇！
Whoa!

1535
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,420
我们说过我们不会大声说出来的
Thought we said we weren't gonna say that out loud.

1536
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,360
听听你说的，艾琳
You see,the fact you say that, Erin,

我这没有
I don't have it.

1579
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,930
你没有锁住...他妈的...

你能滚开吗？

- E, what the fuck? Calm down. - I'm tired of you

1588
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,510
他妈的把我当傻子似的说话

1589
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,810
真是幼稚
A child is what you are.

1590
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:11,350
好吗？我不是傻子，帕蒂

This is behavior I've come to know and love.

Do you understand me?Really, I can't...

1594
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,550

- 我累了，杰夫，好吗？   - 大家都累了！
- I'm tired, Jeff, okay? - Everybody's tired!

这事又没发生在你身上

你什么意思，没发生在我身上？

1599
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:26,610
你他妈的睁大眼睛看看
Could you just open your eyes for one fucking second,

因为都在绕着你转，好吗？
to orbit around you. Okay?

1605
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,410
你他妈的根本不知道这...
You have no fucking idea how much...

1606
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:40,440
你他妈表现得好像这对他来说很容易似的！
You act like this is fucking easy for him!

1607
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,680
我什么时候表现出这很容易了？
When do I act like this is easy?

1608
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,680
昨晚，他昏昏沉沉的
Last night, he's fucking wasted

1609
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,320
- 身上都是他自己吐的东西       - 嘿...

是我把他清理干净了
And I have to clean him up.

1611

没有任何人帮我
And nobody else is there helping me.

1612
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,960
哦，所以是我的错了？
Oh, it's my fault?

1613
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:49,820
是我把他弄上床
I have to carry him to the bed.

1614
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,640
你他妈现在就得说那些吗？
Can you not fucking say that right now?

1615
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,420
- 什么？ - 你现在

01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:55,870
我他妈不在乎，我他妈一点也不在乎
I don't give a fuck.I don't give a shit.

1618
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:59,070
好吧，也许在埃姆斯伯里他们没教你些基本礼貌，不是吗？
Well, maybe they don't teach you manners in Amesbury, huh?

1619
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,700
你他妈再提一次埃姆斯伯里，帕蒂
You say one more fucking thing about Amesbury, Patty,

1620
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,400
我他妈就一拳打你脸上，听懂了吗？
I'll punch you in the fucking face, you understand?

1621
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,700
- 别想恐吓我             - 给我上车！
- Don't you threaten me. - Get in the car!

1622
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,780
上车，给我上车
Go. Get in the car.

1623
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,330
你就让她这么和我说话？
You gonna let her talk to me this way?

1624
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,690
你还是他妈的给我滚，你不是和我们一起的
You just fuckin' walk away.You're not on the team.

1625
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,460
你能告诉到底怎么回事吗？
So you gonna tell me what's goin' on?

他的妈妈

1631
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,840
对我每做的一件事都大吼大叫
for every fuckin' thing I have ever done.

1632
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,760
我早就知道会这样
I knew this was gonna happen.

1633
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,470
这就是你所做的，你承担的太多了
This is what you do,you just take on too much.

1634
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,700
你专注于他人的问题
You take on other people's problems

1635
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,870
反而忘记了自己的
and you forget yourself.

1636
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:40,970
额，这他妈是什么？
Uh, what the fuck is this?

1637
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,450
你是...请告诉我你只是在垃圾箱里发现了这个
Did... Please tell me you found this in a dumpster

1638
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,390
而且你在跟我开玩笑
and you're playing some prank on me.

1639
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,910
我是在开玩笑，好的，额...妈的
I'm just kidding.Okay. Uh... Fuck.

01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:54,860
五周
Five weeks.

1642
01:20:58,910 --> 01:20:59,820
他知道吗？
Does he know?

1643
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,470
不知道
No.

1644
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,760
我打算今晚告诉他
I'm tellin' him tonight.

1645

昨天又在新闻上看到了他

1648
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,510
转的不错
That's good rotation on that.

1649
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,150
像是在烤羊肉串
It's like a shish kebab.

1650
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:22,650
烧了它
Burn that shit.

1651
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:23,980
哦，耶，点起来
Oh, yeah, light that up.

1652
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,650
他和...他那丑不拉几的牛仔帽
Him and that...That goddamn cowboy hat.

1653
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:28,150
那顶帽子才是整个事的重点
It's a whole event, that hat.

1654

他真的在日常生活中也戴着那东西？

1655
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,840
你还在说那个墨西哥男？

是哥斯达黎加，天啊，鲍勃

我的天啊

1659
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,060
我和你说，我真的想见见那家伙
I tell ya what, I'd really like to meet that guy.

Costa Rican, Mexican,Honduran, whatever he is.

1661
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,770

Not for him,you wouldn't be sittin' here

1665
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:50,460

1666
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,790
仔细想想，没准该让他结账
Come to think of it,maybe he ought to pay.

1667
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,210
嘿，杰夫，我不是应该带你
Hey, Jeffie,wasn't I supposed to take you

1668

01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:23,120
杰夫

1674
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:23,120
你本应该在这的

我不知道，我还挺喜欢披萨的
I dunno.I like pizza, too.

1684
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,090
别忘了我下的单
Don't forget my order.

1685
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,530
嘿，你是那个人，坐轮椅的那个

1691
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,690
我们就在距离爆炸发生的地方的
We work, like, 10 blocks away

1692
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:11,950
10个街区以外的地方工作
from where the bombin' happened.

1693
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,740
- 好的  - 实在太疯狂了，不是吗？
- Yeah. - It's fuckin' crazy, right?

1694
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:14,680
是的，就在现场

- 我们就在那           - 就在那
- We were right there. - Right there.

我们都他妈看到了
We saw the whole fuckin' thing.

1697
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,000
- 嘿，你还知道吗？            - 好的
- Hey, you know what, though? - No shit.

1698
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:20,970
我想问你下，那件事
Let me ask you.That whole thing,

1699
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:22,960
- 完全就是一个阴谋，不是吗？  - 迈泰？
- it was a conspiracy, right? - Mai tais?

1700
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,220
完全就是个骗局
The whole thing was a hoax.

1701
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,100
是的
Yeah.

1702
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,030
就是一个该死的假新闻
It was like a fuckin' false flag.

1703
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:30,550
根本什么也没发生，就是胡扯蛋
It was like it didn't happen.It was all, like, bullshit.

1704
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:33,530
好让他妈的奥巴马可以派我们去伊朗打仗
Fuckin' so Obama could send us to war with Iran.

1705
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:36,090
我们不会告诉任何人的
We're not gonna tell anybody.

1706
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,060
- 什么？ - 你...
- What?  - You...

1707
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,860
你也为爆炸付出了代价
You got paid to do the bombing.

1708
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,710
他妈的奥巴马策划了那件事情
Fuckin' Obama did this whole thing

1709
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,320
是派我们去伊朗打仗的借口，兄弟
so we'd go to a war with Iran, bro.

1710
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,410
你他妈的在说些什么？
What the fuck are you talking about?

1711
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:45,080
- 他说到了重点     - 嘿，你知道吗？
- He's got a point.- Hey, you know what?

1712
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:46,260
我们和伊朗要准备打仗了
We're already at war with Iran,

1713
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:47,920

- The fuck you talkin' about? - Fuck you.

1716
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,560
这家伙简直就是他妈的胡说八道
This guy's fuckin' phony-baloney.

1717
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,010

- Easy, easy... - Phony-baloney.

1718
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,300
操你妈的！

1719
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:58,160
嘿，冷静，兄弟！赛，别冲动
Hey, come on, man!Say, take it easy.

1720
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,090
你他妈的做披萨的，你个狗屎
You fuckin' make pizza,you piece of shit.

1721
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,800
我操你妈的
Fuck you, man.

1722
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,820
你他妈就是傻逼，兄弟
You're fuckin' nuts, buddy.

1723
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,250
来啊！来他妈的打我啊！
Come on!Somebody fuckin' hit me!

1724
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,140
他妈的打我，啊？

1727
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,250
嘿，住手，住手
Hey, stop, stop.

1728
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,360
我准备给你打电话的时候
I got your messages after,

1729
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:26,050
我收到了你的短信
when I was tryin' to call you.

1730
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:28,030
简直...简直就是胡扯，杰夫
That's...That's such bullshit, Jeff.

1731
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,200
你喝醉了？
You drunk?

1732
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,330
没有
Not anymore.

1733
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,490
你本来今晚打算什么时候过去？
Were you ever gonna show up tonight?

1734
01:24:57,570 --> 01:24:59,630
还是你只是想把我一个人晾在那？
Or were you just gonna leave me sitting there?

1735
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,360
这是什么？
What is this?

1736
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:08,700
- 打开它   - 这是什么？
- Open it. - What is it?

1737
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:09,890
- 打开它 - 为什么？
- Open it.   - Why?

1738
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,020
打开信封
Open the letter.

1739
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,760
“你会遇到一个”
"Someone small and wonderful"

1740
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,220
“小而美妙的人”
"is about to happen to you."

1741
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:24,290
“小而...”
"Someone small and..."

1742
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,050
这他妈是个玩笑吧？
Is this a fuckin' joke?

1743
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,890
不，不是玩笑，我为什么要拿这个开玩笑？
No, it's not a joke.Why would I joke about this?

1744
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:40,870
这看起来像...
Is this like a...

1745
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:42,320
是的
Yeah.

1746
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,280
怎么可能...
Like what...

1747
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,280
我做不到
I can't do this.

1748
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,080
你从不为什么人而露面
Someone else you don't show up for.

1749
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:00,250
艾琳，你...你...
Erin, you... You...

1750
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:03,120
杰夫，我为了你放弃了我的家人
Jeff, I gave up my family for you.

1751
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,450
还有我的工作，我是不会放弃这个的
And my job.I'm not giving this up, too.

1752
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,770
这比你重要得多
This is bigger than you.

1753
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,400
我还以为你很小心的
I thought you were careful.

1754
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,060
小心？
Careful?

1755
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:13,000
我做不到，我做不到
I can't do this，I can't do it.

1756
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,560
我无法抚养一个孩子，我无法照顾他
I can't raise a kid.I can't look after him.

1757
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,290
我不能...我不能照顾...
I can't... I can't look...

1758
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,020
我该怎么做？
What am I supposed to do?

1759
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,430
在背后追他？
I'm supposed to chase after him?

1760
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,330
在他跑的时候在后面追他吗？
Like, I'm supposed to chase after him?

1761
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,020
我怎么能照顾好他？
How am I gonna take care of him?

1762
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,480
我会...我会搞砸这一切的
I'm gonna...I'm gonna mess him up.

1763
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,050
是的，你会搞砸这一切的
Yes, you are gonna mess him up.

1764
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,220
但不是因为你没有腿
But not because you don't have legs.

1765
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,110
是因为你他妈就还是个孩子
Because you're a fucking kid still.

1766
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,310
你让你妈妈像是
You let your mom push you around

1767
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,280
推着婴儿车里的孩子似的围着你到处转
like a baby in a stroller.

1768
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,820
哦，去你的，艾琳
Oh, fuck you, Erin.

1769
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:34,720
你就是这样做的！
You do!

1770
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:35,830
去你的，艾琳！
Fuck you, Erin!

1771
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,920
你从来就没有露面过一次
You just have to show up for once.

1772
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,220
- 是吗？   - 是的
- Show up? - Yes.

1773
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,540
- 是吗？   - 是的！
- Show up? - Yes!

1774
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:44,040
我他妈为你露面了！为了你！
I fucking showed up for you!I showed up!

1775
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,030
我是为了你才站在那里的！
I was standing there for you!

1776
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:47,700
- 哦，他妈的...       - 看看我现在的样子！
- Oh, fuckin' what... - And look what it got me!

1777
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,170
所以归咎到底都是我的错了，是吗？
So this is my fault, then?

1778
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,800
我为你露面了！
I showed up for you!

1779
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,040
这一切都是我的错了，是吗？
All of this is my fault, right?

1780
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,300
我为你露面了！
I showed up for you!

1781
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,810
这吓不到我！只是露个面而已！
It doesn't scare me!Just show up, that's it!

1782
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:59,210
我做不到！做不到！做不到！我做不到！
I can't! I can't! I can't!I can't do it!

1783
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,210
你为什么还要理我？
Why do you even want me?

1784
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:04,090
为什么？我就是一个傻逼！
Why? I'm such a fuckup!

1785
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,540
做不到，我做...我做不到，做不到
Can't do it. I'm not...I can't do it. I can't.

1786
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,930
不要离开我，艾琳！
Don't walk away from me. Erin!

1787
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:30,670
艾琳！
Erin!

1788
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:34,980
艾琳！
Erin!

1789
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:38,280
不要离开我
Don't walk away from me.

1790
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,990
艾琳！艾琳！
Erin! Erin!

1791
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,850
艾琳！
Erin!

1792
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:46,160
艾琳，不要离开我...艾琳！
Erin, don't walk away from...Erin!

1793
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:48,770
嘿！
Hey!

1794
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,260
他妈管好你自己的事！
Mind your own fuckin' business!

1795
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:19,240
嘿！
Hey!

1796
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:24,140
艾琳！
Erin!

1797
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,180
嘿！
Hey!

1798
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,950
开门！
Open the door!

1799
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,950
艾琳！
Erin!

1800
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,190
艾琳，艾琳！
Erin. Erin.

1801
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:48,510
艾琳，艾琳！
Erin. Erin!

1802
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,490
求你了！求你了！求你了！
Please!Please! Please!

1803
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,220
去帮其他人吧
Go help somebody else.

1804
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,650
躺下，有我呢，有我呢
Lay back, I got you.I got you.

1805
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:56,390
帮其他人去！
Help somebody else!

1806
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:59,890
冷静
Stay calm.

1807
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:02,260
去帮其他人吧，我没事
Go help somebody else.I'm good.

1808
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:15,570
这很重要
This one's critical.

1809
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:43,130
我们需要帮助
We need help.

1810
01:30:51,310 --> 01:30:52,450
坚持住，放轻松
Hold on. Just relax.

1811
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,950
你会没事的，等等就有人来了
You're going to be okay.Help is coming.

1812
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:00,700
这里！这里需要把轮椅
Over here!We need a chair over here.

1813
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,510
艾琳...
Erin...

1814
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,710
求你了，开门
Please, open the door.

1815
01:31:41,690 --> 01:31:42,500
卡洛斯
Carlos.

1816
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,870
杰夫
Jeff.

1817
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:56,710
哦，你要些什么吗？
Oh, you want one of these?

1818
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:58,380
额...咖啡，谢谢
Uh... Coffee, please.

1819
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,490
不想要来瓶啤酒什么的吗？
Want to have a beer,anything like that?

1820
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,620
不用了，谢谢
No. Thank you.

1821
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,120
现在喝酒对我来说太早了
It's too early for me.

1822
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:08,190
对我来说并不早
Not for me.

1823
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:12,090
好的，谢谢你能来
Well, thanks for showing up.

1824
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,670
这是我力所能及的事
It's the least I could do.

1825
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:28,040
所以...
So...

1826
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,350
嗯
Yeah.

1827
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:36,060
你为什么会在那？
Why were you there?

1828
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,480
在终点线吗？
At the finish line?

1829
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:40,760
是的，我的意思是，你知道，戴着这样的帽子
Yeah, I mean, y'know, like,based on that hat

1830
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:43,720
根据我有限的空气动力学知识
and my limited knowledge of aerodynamics,

1831
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:45,650
我想你不是去跑步的
I assume it wasn't to run.

1832
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:49,390
不是，不是，我...我不是去跑步的，我...
No, no, I... I wasn't there to run, I...

1833
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:51,500
我是为了我的儿子们去的
I was there for my boys.

1834
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,700
他们跑在...
They were running in the...

1835
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,170
不，不，我的...
No, no, my...

1836
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:57,410
我的儿子们都去世了
My boys are dead.

1837
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:01,770
我天
Shit.

1838
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:04,410
他们一年前就去世了
They died years ago.

1839
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:06,310
额...
Uh...

1840
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:08,520
哦，谢谢
Oh. Thank you.

1841
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,590
你有孩子吗？
Do you have kids?

1842
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:24,320
啊，额...
Mmm. Uh...

1843
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,400
好吧
Mmm.

1844
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,860
艾利克斯，额，我的大儿子
Alex, uh, was my oldest.

1845
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,140
额，他是一名海军陆战队员
Uh, he was a Marine,

1846
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:38,040
但他在纳贾夫被一名狙击手枪杀了
but he got killed by a sniper in Najaf.

1847
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:38,040
纳贾夫：伊斯兰教什叶派在伊拉克的圣地，位于伊拉克南部

1848
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:41,310
你知道，我之所以知道是
You know, the way I find out is,

1849
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:43,550
因为有一辆车停在我家前面...
a van pulls up in front of my house and...

1850
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:47,150
然后三个陆战队员下了车
And three Marines, they get out.

1851
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,750
但是我早就知道了
But I knew.

1852
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,560
在他们按门铃之前我就知道了
I knew before they rang the doorbell, I knew.

1853
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,100
然后我做了件很愚蠢的事，不是吗？
And then I did something very stupid, right?

1854
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,300
我抓起一罐汽油和喷灯
I grabbed a can of gasoline and a blowtorch

1855
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:04,610
从他们身边跑过去...
and I ran past them and...

1856
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:09,250
然后把我自己锁在了他们的车里
And I locked myself in their van.

1857
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,590
他们试着劝我出来，喷灯...
They tried to pull me out. The...

1858
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,510
喷灯点燃的话，我还有，额...
The blowtorch sparked and I, um...

1859
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,480
那些陆战队员
Those Marines,

1860
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,300
他们都可能会死，但他们救我了
they could have died,and they saved me.

1861
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:28,930
这是最糟糕的，我...
The worst part is, I...

1862
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,800
我不得不在我儿子的葬礼上抬棺
I had to go to my son's funeral on a stretcher.

1863
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,410
我并不为此感到骄傲，你知道的
I'm not proud of that, you know.

1864
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:41,810
你另一个儿子呢？
What about your other son?

1865
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,380
布莱恩
Brian.

1866
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,100
你让我想起了布莱恩
You remind me of Brian.

1867
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,390
他自杀了
He took his own life.

1868
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,790
这对他来说太难承受了
It was too much for him.

1869
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,850
失去他的哥哥，还有看到我那鬼样子
You know, losing his brother,and seeing me like that.

1870
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,930
妈的，卡洛斯
Shit, Carlos.

1871
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:06,730
我无法告诉你我有多想
I can't tell you how much

1872
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:10,310
我希望在他们需要我的时候我能在他们身边
I wish I had been there for them when they needed me.

1873
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:15,840
嗯，但是现在我...
Hmm. But now I...

1874
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,840
我周游全国，与士兵交谈
I travel the country,talking to soldiers.

1875
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,320
大多是有创伤后应激障碍和抑郁症的
Mostly about PTSD and depression.

1876
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:26,220
尽我所能去帮助他们
I help a little.

1877
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:28,810
是它推动着我继续生活下去
And it keeps me going.

1878
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:32,630
但是事实是...
But the truth is...

1879
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:36,890
我依旧还没有明白
I don't understand.

1880
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:38,620
嗯
Mmm.

1881
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,720
那天我在终点线
I was there that day at the finish line

1882
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:55,560
为我的儿子们分发美国国旗
handing out American flags for my boys.

1883
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,410
第一颗炸弹爆炸时
When the first bomb went off,

1884
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,950
我抬头一看，看到一个大火球
I looked up and I saw a big ball of fire

1885
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,040
我的身体想跑
and my body wanted to run.

1886
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:19,570
但我想，是时候了，不是吗？
But I thought,this is a moment, huh?

1887
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,350
做出一个更好的选择
Make a better choice.

1888
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:25,140
所以我跑向火里，然后看到了你
So I ran to the fire and there you were.

1889
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,440
帮你
Helping you

1890
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:30,220
让我感觉
made me feel

1891
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:33,310
像是在帮我的儿子
like I had helped my son.

1892
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,410
对此我很感激
And for that, I am grateful.

1893
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,950
你很感激？
You're grateful?

1894
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:44,630
是的
Yeah.

1895
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,300
你帮助了我，就像我帮助了你
You help me as much as I help you.

1896
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:53,850
所以我来是想说“谢谢”
And I came here to say,"Thank you."

1897
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:00,550
嗯
Hmm.

1898
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:04,580
转到语音信箱了，是吗？
Straight to voicemail, huh?

1899
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,390
我不怪你
I don't blame ya.

1900
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,620
听着，我一直在想，额...
Listen,I've been thinking, um...

因为你已经在和一个又笨又大的孩子打交道了

有一次
There was this, like,there was this time

你想就这样走出去

你不能这样做

你知道怎么做
