1
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,930
Yeah! Nice job! Nice pass!

2
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,310
St. Francis High School basketball phenom

3
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,810
Ty Crane, who they recruited just last year,

4
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,170
is widely held as the next LeBron James.

5
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,640
We simply know him as "The Crane."

6
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,280
Come on.

7
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,890
Come on, y'all! Timo, let's go man, come on.

8
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,330
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,840
Where you at? Where you at?

10
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,510
Pick him up! Pick him up!

11
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,120
- Hey, son.  - Hey.

12
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,560
Right here, right here.

13
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,320
- Blue ball!  - Good D, baby!

14
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,190
- Damn!  - What the hell are you doing, y'all?

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,390
- You took three steps this way.  - Yo, l put my fist up, man.

16
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,940
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing the ball, man. Damn.

17
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,440
- Get your man!  - l knew it. l knew it.

18
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,680
Yeah!

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,710
St. Francis is up by 22.

20
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,450
Stay out of my way, bitch. l own you.

21
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,600
- Oh, hell no!  - Bitch!

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,700
Let's go! Let's go!

23
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,290
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

24
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,670
- Let me go!  - Hey! Hey!

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,070
l'm good. Get off me!

26
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,940
Get off me, get off me!

27
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,410
That's it! Game's over!

28
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,850
Game's over!

29
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,420
Crane. Great game, great game.

30
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,680
Tell everyone out there what it feels like to be the next LeBron James.

31
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,450
LeBron James? l'm the only Ty Crane.

32
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,960
All right, you heard it here first, "the only Ty Crane."

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,660
Why do all the benchwarmers always got something to say?

34
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,300
We watching the damn game, that's why.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,990
- You got a good view, huh?  - Yeah.

36
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,170
Ty Crane outscored our whole team by himself.

37
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,740
- Wonder how that happened.  - We had nothing but 32 points.

38
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,840
l got 1 2 of them. What did you get, Kenyon?

39
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,840
Just shut up, dog. The Crane swooped down on you

40
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,180
and delivered a basket of beat-down. He clowned you, dog.

41
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,110
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.  - He had you on lock the whole game.

42
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,750
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth before l close it for good.

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
You didn't do shit either the whole game.

44
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,660
What, homey? l will slap the taste out your mouth!

45
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,880
- Can we all just get along?  - Shut your little ass up!

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,150
- You didn't even play!  - That's what l'm talking about.

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,090
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!  - You got two points in 1 6 minutes,

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,460
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.  - Exactly!

49
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,100
Timo, you was in the whole time, you never even touched the rock.

50
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,930
You didn't do shit. You might as well...

51
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,470
- Who was you passing the ball to?  - You were playing and didn't do shit!

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,450
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond High School all-American, 1 9 72.

53
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,420
Good to see you, sir.

54
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,780
l was really happy to see you in the stands tonight.

55
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,290
l have to tell you, sir, l haven't made up my mind yet.

56
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,490
As l've told you, it's time for me to step down.

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,960
Last few years have been really tough.

58
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,140
Well, losing's hard, sir.

59
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,270
This isn't about losing games, Kenny.

60
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,770
l can't get them to show up for school, for practice.

61
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,440
l can't get parents involved, and l'm done chasing kids in the streets

62
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,140
and pulling them into the gym.

63
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,940
Yeah, it's a tough job.

64
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,320
Richmond is a tough little city.

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,950
When l saw you here tonight, l thought, "l got him. He's in."

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,060
Well, actually, l was here for another reason.

67
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,890
My son plays for St. Francis.

68
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,590
He does?

69
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,800
- Which kid was he?  - Well, you didn't see him.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,270
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.  - That's great. Great school.

71
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,970
What, you wanna go?

72
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,510
- Hey!  - Lyle, bring it!

73
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,950
Let him go. You think everybody's scared of you? l ain't scared of you!

74
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,490
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be trying to act all hard all the time, man?

75
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,120
God, l'm sick of you, man!

76
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,860
You know, that school was rough when l went there.

77
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,560
lt's way beyond that now.

78
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,460
Well, then, just forget about it. Don't even discuss it again.

79
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,800
l can't quite do that. Coach officially offered me the job tonight.

80
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,200
The clock's ticking.

81
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,280
And when you say "offering job," there's usually money involved.

82
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,850
Yeah, there might be a thousand bucks in it for me.

83
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,450
For five months of work?

84
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,590
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

85
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,080
And the team, it's so bad.

86
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,090
Those boys, they're so angry and undisciplined.

87
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,230
And besides, you know, you don't have the time.

88
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,920
You're trying to open up a second store.

89
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,530
Exactly, l don't have the... Hell, l don't have any time.

90
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,760
And you promised to take your girlfriend to Mexico.

91
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,430
And l'm definitely keeping that promise.

92
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,870
There's no way l'm not going to Mexico

93
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,130
and hanging out on the beach with you in your bikini.

94
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,540
l can't take that job.

95
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,480
So when do you start?

96
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,920
- You should've spoken to me first.  - Why?

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,490
- lt was a personal choice for me.  - So, what happens to me?

98
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,210
You still gonna come to my games?

99
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,260
l'll probably miss most of your games, Damien. l'm sorry.

100
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,980
Then l'll go to Richmond and play for you.

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,390
No.

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,220
Well, why not?

103
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,100
- Dad, you've always been my coach.  - This is a great school, Damien.

104
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,130
lt puts you in a great position for college.

105
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,770
Dad, l'm a freshman!

106
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,570
Just because l'm coaching at Richmond,

107
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,240
it doesn't change our plans for your future, all right?

108
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,300
Yo, my man, l need a vial, man. You got that good dope? How much?

109
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,220
You forgot to bring your lD, didn't you?

110
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,450
- l forgot it.  - Every day.

111
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,490
Good morning. Ken Carter.

112
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,500
- Thanks.  - Here you go, sir.

113
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,260
Hey, yo, what's up?

114
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,870
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.  - You too, ma'am.

115
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,310
lf the offer still stands, l'd like to coach the team.

116
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,280
Well, l hope you're up for the task. These young men need discipline.

117
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,020
The job comes with a $1 ,500 stipend

118
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,320
and a major time commitment for the next four months.

119
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,520
- l accept.  - Great.

120
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,300
We're thrilled to have you. Gentlemen, l hate to be abrupt,

121
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
but l do have a budget meeting l need to run to.

122
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,030
Mr. Carter, is there anything you need from us?

123
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,610
Well, l just need about 25 copies of this document.

124
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,480
- l'm all set.  - Ray, would you see to it

125
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
that Mr. Carter...? Coach Carter gets these copies?

126
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,520
- Will do.  - Gentlemen.

127
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,550
l'm not saying this is not gonna be a challenge,

128
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,220
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

129
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,420
Just keep in mind, these are good boys.

130
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,890
Guys! Guys!

131
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,690
Guys!

132
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,200
Now, as you know, l've been... Hey!

133
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
You know l've been looking for a new coach

134
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,300
to take over for me this season.

135
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,000
This is Ken Carter. He went to Richmond.

136
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,740
He was a two-sport all-American.

137
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,250
Still holds records for scoring, assists, steals.

138
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,890
Basketball scholarship to George Mason University.

139
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,210
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

140
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Now, let's give him the respect he's due.

141
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,060
- They're all yours, coach.  - Thank you, sir.

142
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,160
Good afternoon, young men.

143
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,240
As Coach White said, l'm your new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

144
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,210
l guess l need to speak louder so you can hear me.

145
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,840
l'm Ken Carter, your new basketball coach.

146
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,340
We hear you, dog. But we can't see you.

147
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,040
The glare from your big, black-ass head

148
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,220
is hella shiny, man. Damn, do you buff it?

149
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,790
Oh, you got jokes to go along with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

150
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,490
First of all, if you need to know my credentials,

151
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,060
as Coach White said, they're on the wall there behind you.

152
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:09,900
Secondly, if basketball practice starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

153
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,670
You, shooting the ball. What's your name, sir?

154
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,810
Jason Lyle, but l ain't no sir.

155
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,410
You're not a sir.

156
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,640
Well, are you a madam?

157
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,050
- Little bitch. Bitch.  - As of now, you are a sir.

158
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,950
So are the rest of you.

159
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,720
"Sir" is a term of respect.

160
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,490
And you will have my respect until you abuse it.

161
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,120
Mr. Lyle, how many games did you guys win last season?

162
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,460
Like four wins, 22 losses.

163
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,930
- Sir.  - Sir.

164
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,710
l'm going to give you contracts.

165
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,550
lf you sign and honor your side of them,

166
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,910
we are going to be successful.

167
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,550
Damn, do l get a signing bonus for signing this contract?

168
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,520
Yes, sir. You get to become a winner.

169
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,690
Because if there's one thing l know, it is this:

170
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,630
The losing stops now.

171
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,160
Starting today, you will play like winners, act like winners,

172
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,210
and most importantly, you will be winners.

173
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,940
lf you listen and learn, you'll win basketball games.

174
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,440
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

175
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,150
...is the key to winning out there.

176
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,080
This contract states that you will maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

177
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,120
You will attend all your classes

178
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,090
and you will sit in the front row of those classes.

179
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,960
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.  - Excuse me.

180
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,830
- Did you say something, sir?  - Worm was wondering,

181
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,970
are you some country church nigga, with your tie on and all that?

182
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,760
- Right.  - That's what you wanna say, right?

183
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,200
And what is your name, sir?

184
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,440
l'm Timo Cruz, sir.

185
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,840
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

186
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,550
what you should both know is we treat ourselves with respect.

187
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,190
We don't use the word "nigga."

188
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,290
Are you some preacher man or some shit?

189
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,720
Because God ain't gonna do you no good in this neighborhood.

190
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,020
- l live in this neighborhood, sir.  - Sir.

191
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,220
Can you believe this uppity Negro, sir?

192
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,420
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

193
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,040
- ...leave the gym right now.  - For what?

194
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,070
l'll ask you one last time to leave the gym

195
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,800
- before l help you leave.  - Before you what?

196
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,640
Do you even know who l am?

197
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,380
From what l can see, a very confused and scared young man.

198
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,990
Scared of who? Scared of you? l'm supposed to be scared of you?

199
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,260
Nigga, l ain't scared of nobody. l will lay your ass out.

200
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,720
l don't think so.

201
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,220
All right.

202
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,140
What you doing? Get off me!

203
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,170
Teachers ain't supposed to touch students.

204
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,180
l'm not a teacher.

205
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,770
l'm your new basketball coach.

206
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,660
This ain't over!

207
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,110
ls there anybody else who's not feeling this contract?

208
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,710
Come on, man, where you going?

209
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,180
l don't do high school contracts.

210
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,860
Tell us when you need the real ballers.

211
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,150
l will do that, sir.

212
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,850
There goes our two leading scorers from last season, man.

213
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,220
Then l guess we'll have new leading scorers this season, huh?

214
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,260
Now, l cannot teach you the game of basketball

215
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,460
until your conditioning is at a level that allows me to do so.

216
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,840
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

217
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,150
To the baseline!

218
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,350
l presume you all know what suicides are.

219
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,790
So...

220
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,290
l saw the St. Francis game the other night.

221
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,530
None of you have a problem shooting the ball.

222
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,400
You all had a problem getting up and down the court.

223
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,340
lf you are late, you will run.

224
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,380
lf you give me attitude, you will do push-ups.

225
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,720
So you can push-up or shut up.

226
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,390
That's up to you.

227
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,020
- Yo, how many we gonna do?  - Sir.

228
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,720
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

229
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,990
Let's see how many you can do in one hour and seven minutes.

230
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,570
Fellas, don't make me commit homicide.

231
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,310
l said, suicides! Put your hand on the line!

232
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,380
Put your hand on the line!

233
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,550
Damn, l can't keep this shit up, man. l can barely walk.

234
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,210
- l know, my legs is hella sore, son.  - Need some Gatorade or something.

235
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,380
- There go your girl right there, son.  - Yeah.

236
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,150
Hey, what's with you and her homeys? You gonna try to holler at them?

237
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,560
Man, l'm hollering at both of the friends.

238
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,360
- Both of them?  - Yeah, because l need that.

239
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,560
You know, l need variety in my life. l can't just have one girl.

240
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,130
You know what l'm saying? l need both.

241
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,570
Hey.

242
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,030
- What's up, baby?  - How you doing?

243
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,400
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard about that two-for-one special, right?

244
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,510
Two of you, one of me. Now, that's special.

245
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,410
- Please. Whatever, Worm.  - Yeah, special ed.

246
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,210
- Get your arm off me.  - l like this fox.

247
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,850
You working that chinchilla. But, look, baby, me and you...

248
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,620
You need to tell him to stop playing it so close. She don't even like him.

249
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,760
- Why not? Worm's the man.  - Worm is Worm.

250
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,060
Anyway, l got something for the baby today.

251
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,270
We don't even know if it's a baby yet. l mean, it's kind of early.

252
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,180
You ain't even been to the doctor yet.

253
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,450
Hello? l passed the pregnancy test, Kenyon. Three times.

254
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,690
- These are kind of cute, though.  - l know, l got good taste, right?

255
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,370
Yeah, all right.

256
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,560
Precious little shoes.

257
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,830
Well, l got a little somethin'-somethin' for you too.

258
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,730
Thank you.

259
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,680
This definitely is a little something.

260
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,080
- Where'd you get this?  - Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

261
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,820
Kenyon!

262
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,290
- What? What's up?  - What are you doing? Give me!

263
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,320
- Are you crazy?  - Are you crazy?

264
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,090
You got that for 99 cents? l've been there.

265
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,230
You can get three brooms and a bucket for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

266
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,370
That's like thread. That's not even half a shoelace.

267
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,100
Well, would you like to see me in this shoelace?

268
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,100
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

269
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,010
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

270
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,840
Three push-ups and move. One! Two! Three!

271
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,850
Let's go. Explode!

272
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,350
Let me hear you. Let me hear you! Let me hear it.

273
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,750
Explode! Worm, explode!

274
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,320
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

275
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,590
Give me five! Just give me five! Push!

276
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,820
Push! Go! Go! Let me hear you!

277
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,230
Come on, close out! Explode! Let's go!

278
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,530
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

279
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,140
That's ten suicides for the whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

280
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,780
This ain't the track team, man.

281
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,410
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

282
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,110
But you're right.

283
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,450
And because you're right, that's 20 suicides for the entire team

284
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,820
and you get the privilege of joining Mr. Battle

285
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,860
- with 250 push-ups of your own.  - What, are you serious?

286
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,820
- Yeah.  - This is bullshit!

287
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,660
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

288
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,390
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

289
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,040
Because you gave such a good answer

290
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,760
and you gave the coach attitude,

291
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,500
you win the bonus prize of 500 push-ups!

292
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,950
And would you like to go for the grand prize of a thousand?

293
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,380
No, sir.

294
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,350
To the baseline! On my whistle! Let's go!

295
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,350
J.B., come on, baby.

296
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,380
l can't even move, son. Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

297
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,530
- You can't say nothing to him.  - Why can't l say nothing to him?

298
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,020
l'm a white boy? Man, what the...?

299
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,320
Right here. Right here. Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

300
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,690
Where you going, homey? Where you going, huh?

301
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,060
- l ain't got shit.  - What?

302
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,740
Please don't shoot me, man. Go on, take my bag, dog!

303
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,910
Run your shit, homey!

304
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,380
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

305
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,050
Yo, l'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

306
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,950
l'm just playing, B. Look at you!

307
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,330
Damn! l seen y'all walking from up the block

308
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,020
like somebody put a pipe in your asses.

309
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,270
You all right, dog?

310
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,100
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

311
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,830
but y'all damn sure look sad without me.

312
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,100
But you know what? l'm gonna watch y'all play.

313
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,740
See y'all get your asses kicked.

314
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,240
Yo! l'd love to shoot the shit with you bitches all night, but l gotta go.

315
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,740
- All right.  - Yo, who that, man?

316
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,680
That's my cousin, Renny.

317
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,440
l'm gonna check y'all. Come on, let's go.

318
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,590
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

319
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,150
- No, l'm straight, man.  - You sure?

320
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,190
- Yeah, l'm good.  - All right, my nigga.

321
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,590
- One love.  - All right, Lyle!

322
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,750
Don't let nobody else put a pipe up your ass, or you might like it!

323
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,610
Hey, you was scared, huh? l wasn't scared.

324
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,500
The state only requires that they have a 2.0 average to play.

325
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,200
Now, you got in here they need a 2.3.

326
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,710
lf you have a 2.0, you have to score at least 1 050 on the SAT

327
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,440
to be eligible for an athletic scholarship.

328
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,950
lf you have a 2.3, you only need 950.

329
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,820
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

330
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,020
lt shouldn't be that hard to maintain a C-plus.

331
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,590
These boys are student athletes.

332
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,790
"Student" comes first.

333
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,490
lt says they gotta wear coat and ties on game days.

334
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,230
They don't own ties! You gonna supply the ties?

335
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,500
There's a Goodwill and a Salvation Army store

336
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,730
less than two blocks from here.

337
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,410
They got a box full of ties for 50 cents apiece.

338
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,480
Yo, man, what you trying to say, huh?

339
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,140
Oh, we too good to shop at the Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

340
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,750
- Yeah, l ain't that broke.  - This is crazy!

341
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,850
A dress code and they have to sit in the front row in class?

342
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,820
- This is basketball, man!  - And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

343
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,960
lf you want to play basketball on this team,

344
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,890
these are the simple rules you have to follow

345
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,830
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

346
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,370
Now, if you decide to follow these simple rules,

347
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,400
l need you and the boys to sign this contract.

348
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,540
They can bring the contracts to practice tomorrow.

349
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,650
lf you come to practice.

350
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,040
l wanna thank you all for coming out and showing your support,

351
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,160
and l hope l have your support the rest of the season.

352
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,150
- Good night.  - Get up and leave like that?

353
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,590
Look, l have a hard enough time getting my nephew to...

354
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,060
- How you gonna make them wear ties?  - l want the other coach back!

355
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,370
lt's one of your contracts, sir. l've amended that contract.

356
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,840
You require your players to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

357
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,680
l've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

358
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,120
You require ten hours of community service, and l've committed to 50.

359
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,530
Any unexcused absences, any other disciplinary issues at school,

360
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,900
you can nullify this agreement and send me to any school you want.

361
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,140
And how many days do l have to consider this offer?

362
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,710
None.

363
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,500
The second page is a letter you need to sign

364
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,800
that confirms my withdrawal from St. Francis.

365
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,440
- They know l'm leaving.  - What?

366
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,170
- You withdrew from St. Francis?  - l called Richmond.

367
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,110
- They expect me there in the morning.  - You called Richmond?

368
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,320
You should have spoken to me about this.

369
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,660
lt was a personal choice for me.

370
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,390
Well, l can fix all that in the morning.

371
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,230
Sir, please listen. All l wanna do is play for you.

372
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,460
lf l'm one of the top students at Richmond,

373
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,240
l mean one of the top in the whole school, and l have great SATs,

374
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,770
l can go to any college in the country.

375
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,540
l'm asking you to trust me.

376
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,920
You really wanna do this, huh?

377
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,980
Okay.

378
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,630
Part of growing up is making your own decisions

379
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,630
and living with the consequences.

380
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,830
3.7.

381
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,170
And you will earn every minute of playing time.

382
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,810
Open it, please.

383
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,240
Morning, sir.

384
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,350
My name is J. Lyle They call me wild

385
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,350
lt's all right Kenyon's mom tonight

386
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,650
- Say what?  - You might think l'm wrong

387
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,060
But she's got these thongs

388
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Hey, yo, yo, yo. lt's Malcolm X from St. Francis.

389
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,640
- Hey, yo, Malcolm!  - Whatever.

390
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,170
- What's up, man?  - What are you doing here, son?

391
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,940
- l transferred to Richmond.  - Oh, no, son, l think you're just lost.

392
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,610
Well, l am actually lost. Can you tell me how to get to...?

393
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,110
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm, tell your man Fresh Prince here

394
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,290
- how to get to his mansion.  - Fresh bitch.

395
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,390
l hope seeing you in this hallway mean l get to see you on the court today.

396
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,690
l can't wait. With your five browns.

397
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,400
Everybody up.

398
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Today we're going to play defense.

399
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,830
Sorry, sir.

400
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,010
Gentlemen, this is a new player, Damien Carter.

401
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,950
He is my son, and he is late.

402
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,620
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

403
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,620
Sir, it's my first day of school, l had to stay...

404
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,720
Basketball practice starts at 3.

405
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,580
As of 2:55, you are late. Get changed in the locker room.

406
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,700
Do your suicides on the far side of the court so as not to disturb us.

407
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,230
All right, gentlemen, give me two lines!

408
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,900
Okay, young sirs, we're gonna take it to the next level.

409
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,270
Everything l knew about basketball,

410
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,370
l learned from women.

411
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,570
l have a sister, her name's Diane.

412
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,010
She was always on my case about every little thing.

413
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,720
Matter of fact, she still is.

414
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,220
"Turn down that radio! You eat the last piece of cake?

415
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,420
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?"

416
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,920
She was always in my face.

417
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,290
So when l call "Diane,"

418
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,160
we're gonna play straight man-to-man pressure defense.

419
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,440
Worm! No, no, no, no, sir.

420
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,910
Look at your defensive posture.

421
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,450
Come on. Split your man. Back straight, butt down.

422
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,680
This hand guards against the passing lane, this hand protects the crossover.

423
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,680
All right? Palms up! Get your head in the game.

424
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,590
Now we have Delilah.

425
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,190
She was my childhood sweetheart.

426
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,790
Sir, was she hot?

427
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,590
Oh, yes, sir. She was steaming hot.

428
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,370
But she was the devil. That girl was evil.

429
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,680
l remember once she tricked me into stealing brownies

430
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,280
from Christ the King First Baptist Church bake sale.

431
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,640
She smiled and got her way out of it,

432
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,610
while l damn near had to wear a pillow on my butt

433
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,450
for a month before l could sit down.

434
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,290
Delilah, gentlemen. She's our trap defense.

435
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,920
Take notes, freshman. This is as close as you gonna get to playing.

436
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,760
Come on, come on. Move, move! Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!

437
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,940
Now, l know you're all concerned that

438
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,380
we didn't work on our offense during practice.

439
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,610
We have all season to do that.

440
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,120
But what did we do in practice, Mr. Stone?

441
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,680
- Run.  - That's right.

442
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,410
So, what do you think l want you to do on offense tonight?

443
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,020
- Run?  - Correct again.

444
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,460
l want you to run.

445
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,800
l want you to run every second that clock is ticking, all game long.

446
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,000
Put him back on the bench!

447
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,480
Rebound! Rebound! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

448
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,440
Nice pass, baby!

449
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,290
Push it! Push it!

450
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,960
- Screen.  - Screen, baby. Screen. Screen.

451
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,260
- Worm.  - Let's go, Worm.

452
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,240
Stay alert! Pick him up right there!

453
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,770
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!  - What's the call, ref?

454
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,770
White four, fifth. He's out of the game.

455
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,280
- Oh, ref, come...  - That's his fifth foul, coach.

456
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,380
- Time, sir.  - Time out, white.

457
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,070
Bad call, ref! That was a jump ball, damn it!

458
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,880
- Time out, white.  - Come on, fellas.

459
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,650
Come on, huddle up. Hustle up. Get over here.

460
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,220
All right. Huddle up, huddle up.

461
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,420
- Carter, you're in.  - But, coach, he a freshman.

462
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,360
You wanna coach?

463
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,260
All right, take a deep breath, guys. Come on, deep breaths.

464
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,100
- You tired?  - No, sir.

465
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,100
Those guys are exhausted.

466
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,170
That's why this guy's gonna miss that free throw.

467
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,400
When he does, Worm and Lyle are our first option.

468
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,940
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole. Everybody attack the boards, got that?

469
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,280
- Yes, sir.  - All right, Richmond on three.

470
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,410
- One, two, three!  - Richmond!

471
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,250
- All right, let's out, all right?  - Step it up, let's go!

472
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,320
Look alive out there.

473
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,920
All right, guys, you're in better shape than they are. Push it.

474
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,720
Box out, box out.

475
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,300
One shot.

476
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,610
Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!

477
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,540
- Come on! Come on!  - Come on, baby!

478
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,620
All right.

479
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,520
Kenyon!

480
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,890
- Worm!  - Yo, yo.

481
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,970
Oh, yeah!

482
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,530
Yeah! That's what l'm talking about!

483
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,450
- Tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog.  - lt was all you.

484
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,950
A win like that don't mean nothing,

485
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,740
because they can't play anyway, you feel me?

486
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,290
Okay, Shaq, so you dominated down low tonight. Any thoughts?

487
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,290
l dropped a 20-piece. Kobe played his game.

488
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,660
We the champions till we ain't the champions no more.

489
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,660
- Junior Battle.  - Undefeated until...

490
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,600
Yo, man, on the real,

491
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,670
that was the worst game l've ever seen in my life.

492
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,340
l thought that shit would never end. l was dying in the bleachers.

493
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,510
That's right, you were in the bleachers, weren't you?

494
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,270
We were on the court handling our business.

495
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,710
That's right. We 1 -0, bitch.

496
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,510
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B, and y'all barely beat them.

497
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,580
Damn, Timo, why you throwing salt, man?

498
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,450
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

499
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,520
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

500
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,720
l'll knock all y'all off.

501
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,820
- Yo. l'll check y'all later, all right?  - All right.

502
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,590
Yo. Let's do this.

503
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,870
- What's up?  - Here's two bundles.

504
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,840
- All right.  - Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

505
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,570
Yo, l got you.

506
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,020
- How you doing, man?  - Chilling, man.

507
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,080
You look good.

508
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,610
Got some paper for you.

509
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,180
Now we're talking, yeah.

510
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,760
How you living, Timo?

511
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,100
l'm good.

512
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,830
- You all right? For real?  - Yeah.

513
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,170
- Here, take some.  - l'm all right.

514
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,340
No, no, no, take some, please.

515
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,340
You did good, man. You're doing good, bro.

516
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,070
- Thank you.  - Don't thank me, thank you.

517
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,880
You earned it.

518
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,250
Take a nickel bag, okay?

519
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,520
Go get yourself something, man.

520
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,160
- l'm gonna see you?  - Yeah, next week.

521
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,490
Okay, l'm gonna see you.

522
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,230
- Keep it up.  - Yeah.

523
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,050
Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.

524
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,220
Rafeca, l see you looking.

525
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,330
Ain't nobody thinking about you, Worm.

526
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,430
- Oh, okay.  - Gentlemen,

527
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,560
let's review the Hercules game, shall we?

528
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,600
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

529
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,030
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

530
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,430
No, sir. l had 1 2 points and eight assists, sir.

531
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,100
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five turnovers and four missed free throws.

532
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,280
Now, we're talking about fundamentals here.

533
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,040
Until we learn them, l'm adding a practice every morning at 6 a.m.

534
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,380
- Six a.m.?  - We shot 56 percent at...

535
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,720
Mr. Cruz.

536
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,560
Are you lost, sir?

537
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,220
What l gotta do to play?

538
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,600
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know the answer to that question.

539
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,000
Now, as l was saying,

540
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:38,040
as a team, we shot 56 percent from the line.

541
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,040
From now on, before you leave my gym,

542
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,510
you must pay an exit price of 50 made free throws before you can go.

543
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,550
- What?  - That's everybody.

544
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,880
- Come on.  - That's a lot of free throws.

545
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,730
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

546
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,230
Before you can play on this team...

547
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,400
...you owe me...

548
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,170
...2,500 push-ups...

549
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,000
...and 1 ,000 suicides.

550
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,900
- Damn.  - Damn.

551
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,780
And they must be completed by Friday.

552
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,780
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.  - He ain't making that.

553
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,910
Today's flavor: offense.

554
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,090
- Now we talking.  - Now, l have a sister.

555
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,450
Her name is Linda.

556
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,130
Linda is smart, she's political.

557
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,530
Well, actually, she's radical.

558
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,460
Linda's got a big Afro.

559
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,540
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

560
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,070
Before we get into that, let's warm up.

561
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,340
Give me a lay-up line.

562
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,450
- Let's go.  - All right.

563
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,310
Let's do it.

564
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,250
- Damn, how many sisters he got?  - Who knows.

565
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,280
- Come on, get two more over here.  - Break it out.

566
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,820
- Let's go, guys.  - Energy, guys, energy.

567
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,510
We got this, let's go.

568
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,060
- l'm open.  - l got him, l got him.

569
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,820
Right here, right here. l'm open. l'm open.

570
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,330
l'm sorry.

571
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,550
- All right.  - Hey, hey, hey.

572
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,860
- Come on.  - lt's not my fault.

573
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,260
- He was early.  - Hey.

574
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,130
Yes, it's important to move without the ball,

575
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,170
but you gotta be patient on the weak-side screen.

576
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,400
Set up your man and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

577
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,740
Okay. Switch it up.

578
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,380
We got it, come on. Let's go. Let's get it.

579
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,520
- And call out them picks.  - Yeah, yeah, all right.

580
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,860
What is your deepest fear, Mr. Cruz?

581
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,620
That you're inadequate?

582
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,590
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

583
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,930
Go home.

584
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,240
All right, l want seven passes before you shoot.

585
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,140
- Seven.  - All right.

586
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,440
- l got him. l got him.  - Get that ball in there.

587
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,550
You know your task is impossible before Friday, right?

588
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,120
Move.

589
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,420
Work it, work it.

590
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,990
Run it back.

591
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,390
What time your mom getting home?

592
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,350
She doesn't get off for another hour.

593
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,230
Oh, that's Myles.

594
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,230
What?

595
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,510
Say, "Hi, Uncle Kenyon."

596
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,480
Say, "Hi."

597
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,950
All right, don't worry about it.

598
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,720
He'll go back to sleep right after his bottle.

599
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,150
Right, boo-boo?

600
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,730
Yeah, probably in time for your mom to get home.

601
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,400
Or when your cousin get back from getting her hair fried and dyed,

602
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,300
like she can afford all that shit. lt's her baby anyway.

603
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,700
Well, my mother had to work a double shift,

604
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,460
but they cut her overtime.

605
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,970
And my cousin, don't be trying to dis her.

606
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,940
You said we'd be alone. You call this alone?

607
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,910
Well, that's why we need our own spot.

608
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,850
Did you turn this off?

609
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,250
- Yeah, it was boiling.  - Oh, come on.

610
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,320
Well, turn it down, not off.

611
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,330
This is milk, butter and cheese. We can't afford to waste this.

612
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,860
And hold him up.

613
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,510
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

614
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,610
All right, Myles, here we go.

615
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,280
Gotta cool off a minute.

616
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,980
Ever think about what you were gonna do before you were pregnant?

617
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,390
What you mean, going to junior college?

618
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,750
Yeah.

619
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,480
l mean, yeah, l thought about it.

620
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,700
l could go later, l guess.

621
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,560
You have to get some work after you have the baby.

622
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,730
Me too.

623
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,730
- So l'll work.  - How you gonna go to school?

624
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,600
Why you asking me all these questions?

625
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,400
And you gotta put your hands under his arm.

626
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,440
You gotta sit him on your chest. Hold him.

627
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,050
- l am holding him.  - You ain't doing it right.

628
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,740
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

629
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,510
Look...

630
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,220
l don't know how to do this.

631
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,120
You'll get it.

632
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,800
Right?

633
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,770
Look, l gotta help my mom with some stuff.

634
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,340
- See you later, all right?  - All right.

635
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,430
Call me later, okay?

636
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,540
Later.

637
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,880
All right, keep it riding on somebody.

638
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,110
- Don't get lost in there.  - Move it. Move it.

639
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,150
Stay with your man.

640
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,030
- Box out, box out!  - Position.

641
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,760
Guys...

642
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,530
Up. Up.

643
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,700
Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,390
You don't get to your man, stand, watch the ball.

645
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,130
When the ball goes up, get in good defensive position,

646
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,270
get your body on your man and explode to the ball.

647
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,840
All right? Let's go.

648
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,340
Run it. You got it.

649
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,950
- Go on, do it.  - Forward pass. Forward pass.

650
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,910
- Work it.  - There you go.

651
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,320
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling a very different story.

652
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,920
l wish you would. Yes, ma'am, l'm here all week.

653
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,230
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?

654
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,830
Oh, they're great, ma'am. We're 1 -0.

655
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,430
Very good.

656
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,890
How may l help you?

657
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,930
Well, l had my boys sign contracts

658
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,800
requiring them to meet certain academic standards.

659
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,640
Yes, l believe one of the faculty members mentioned that.

660
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,710
Very interesting scare tactic.

661
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,780
Well, in order for that to be successful,

662
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,640
l need their teachers to fill out weekly progress reports

663
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,910
so l'll know how the boys are doing in their classrooms.

664
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,820
- Okay.  - Well, l haven't received anything

665
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,220
from their teachers.

666
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,130
l don't see how this ties in to your job as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

667
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,200
Well, l took this job with the understanding l could do it my way.

668
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,800
And you can.

669
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,770
Our next faculty meeting is in two weeks.

670
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,410
l'll remember to bring it up.

671
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,240
Why, that would be great. Thank you, ma'am.

672
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,340
Thank you, sir.

673
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,910
Bring it in, guys.

674
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,120
Let's go, hustle up.

675
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,120
Yo, bring it in, y'all.

676
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,290
All right, that's it for today.

677
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,260
We have a game tomorrow, so get some rest tonight.

678
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,900
And remember, ties and jackets tomorrow.

679
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,460
Clyde.

680
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,840
Mr. Cruz.

681
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,840
l'm impressed with what you've done.

682
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,580
But you came up short.

683
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,590
You owe me 80 suicides and 500 push-ups.

684
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,660
Please leave my gym.

685
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,150
Thanks, Clyde.

686
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,900
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

687
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,370
l'll do push-ups for him.

688
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,730
You said we're a team.

689
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,610
One person struggles, we all struggle.

690
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,840
One player triumphs, we all triumph, right?

691
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,990
l'll do some.

692
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,770
l'll run suicides too.

693
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,140
l'll do some too.

694
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,280
Clyde, keep count.

695
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,460
Call me when they're done.

696
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,060
Defense! Defense!

697
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,320
Push it. Push it. Move, move!

698
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,800
Let's go.

699
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,660
Ball, ball, ball.

700
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,000
Ball, ball, ball.

701
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,170
- Yeah!  - Go.

702
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,140
Move your feet, move your feet.

703
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,310
Go, defense. Go.

704
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,740
Good job. Good job.

705
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,150
- Worm.  - White ball.

706
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:52,520
Palms up, move your feet, right? Come out. Come out. Come out.

707
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,220
- Mr. Cruz!  - Good game, boy.

708
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,990
Hey, hey.

709
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,230
What is your deepest fear, young man?

710
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,600
Go on.

711
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,270
Why he keep saying that, "What's your deepest fear?" What that mean?

712
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,440
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

713
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,510
Move. Move. Move.

714
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,550
No, one more pass.

715
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,060
Hands up.

716
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,200
Three points, Cruz!

717
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,210
What the hell are you doing, Cruz? You allergic to lay-ups?

718
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,680
You do that again and you're going to be glued to the bench.

719
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,520
- Swing it.  - Right here.

720
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,230
Come on, last kick.

721
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,920
Kick it in. Kick it in. Let's go.

722
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,870
You can't guard me, can you? What you gonna do?

723
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,300
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?  - Delilah. Delilah.

724
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,880
Come on, come on, come on.

725
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,570
- Shot.  - Yeah, Jason.

726
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,380
Kenyon, pose for me.

727
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,080
- Smile.  - Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!

728
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,450
Just play the damn game.

729
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,250
Linda, Linda, Linda!

730
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,830
There he is. Yeah.

731
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,930
That's me, baby. That's me. l did that.

732
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,540
l drew that up. Yeah.

733
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,070
Run it again.

734
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,370
All right, 1 -4, 1 -4. Linda, Linda, Linda!

735
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:35,080
All day, baby. All day! Can't stop that.

736
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,190
Can't stop that!

737
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,280
- Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir.  - Thank you, Mr. Worm.

738
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,660
Look at that bow. Look at that.

739
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,600
l tied that. l tied that shit.

740
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,770
Can l get something on the bow? Let me get some.

741
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,210
Are you crazy?

742
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,770
What is wrong with you?

743
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,310
What's wrong with all of you?

744
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,050
Since when is winning not enough?

745
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,620
Playing hard not enough?

746
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,490
No, you have to humiliate your opponent.

747
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:14,490
Taunt him after every score.

748
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,430
You won four games last season.

749
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,820
Four.

750
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:22,260
What gives you the right to taint the game that l love

751
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,160
with trash talk and taunting?

752
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,670
What gives you the right to wear Richmond on your chests

753
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,970
and act like punks?

754
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,610
- Coach, they were jawing too.  - So?

755
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,440
You can't show some class?

756
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,080
Act like a champion?

757
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,750
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

758
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,650
On the line. Now.

759
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,850
- Damn.  - Oh, man, come on.

760
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,010
Listen, shorty, l'm just gonna be real with you, okay?

761
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,370
You're my girl.

762
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,980
l get out on that court and everything is just getting crazy,

763
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,920
all l gotta do is just think about you.

764
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,320
Mr. Lyle.

765
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,390
Why aren't you in...

766
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,230
- ...geometry?  - l'm going there right now, sir.

767
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,930
- Sir, this is Betty.  - Bella.

768
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,000
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

769
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,790
Go to class.

770
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,350
Don't forget that these projects are due at the end of this week.

771
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,780
- So if any of you need extra time...  - Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

772
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,080
- Yes.  - l...

773
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,380
...don't see Junior Battle in this class.

774
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,490
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

775
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,680
We rarely see him, but when we do, it's always special.

776
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,230
Thank you.

777
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,960
"Surprise arrival to the poll is Richmond High at 1 9th."

778
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,870
- Top 20, baby.  - We're 1 9th, dog.

779
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,340
"The Oilers have posted a perfect 9-0 mark,

780
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,530
winning on the road against perennial powerhouses

781
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,140
Xavier and Baxter Union."

782
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,840
Junior, you should read the rest of this.

783
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,850
They blowing you up in this paper.

784
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,420
- Come on, man, read it.  - Man, you know he can't read.

785
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,320
- Man, shut up.  - Shut up, Maddux.

786
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,960
"Richmond center has been big as the Oilers are 'boyed."'

787
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,100
Buoyed. The word is "buoyed."

788
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,770
"Buoyed by Junior Battle's 1 9.8-rebound-a-night numbers."

789
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,640
See, that's my big nigga right there, son. Hey.

790
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,320
lf you was any bigger, you'd be my bigger nigga.

791
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,980
Sit down. Sit down!

792
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,330
"Nigger" is a derogatory term used to insult our ancestors.

793
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,400
See, if a white man used it, you'd be ready to fight.

794
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,440
Your using it teaches him to use it.

795
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,630
You're saying it's cool. Well, it's not cool.

796
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,110
And when you're around me, l don't wanna hear that shit.

797
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,880
- We clear?  - Yes, sir.

798
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,520
- Yes, sir.  - Yes, sir.

799
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,020
Yes, sir.

800
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,450
Mr. Worm,

801
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,130
what is it you want out of this basketball season?

802
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,960
To win that state championship, sir.

803
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,190
Well, who won the state basketball championship last season, Lyle?

804
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,470
Hell if l know, sir.

805
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,840
Does anybody know?

806
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,430
Okay.

807
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,510
What's your father do for a living, Mr. Lyle?

808
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,890
My father's in jail, sir.

809
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,550
Well, l'm sorry to hear that, sir.

810
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,290
But that doesn't have to be your life.

811
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,060
My point's this:

812
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,600
l have four seniors on this team,

813
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,770
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

814
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,740
All of whom l think can play basketball at the college level.

815
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,310
College.

816
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,280
That's a viable option for all of you.

817
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,620
But you have to perform in the classroom to have that chance.

818
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,350
You have to have a vision.

819
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,480
Tell me, how do you see yourselves?

820
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,190
ESPN, baby.

821
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,960
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

822
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,660
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't see you in his classroom very often.

823
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,660
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

824
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,870
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

825
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,580
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

826
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,580
Oh, you can practice, but you can't play

827
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,380
until Mr. Gesek tells me you're caught up in his class.

828
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,020
And that's a shout out to the rest of you.

829
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,620
You signed a contract.

830
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,520
You made a commitment.

831
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,920
Now, l have your schedules and l'll be getting reports from your teachers.

832
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,330
lf you don't perform in the classroom, you will not play.

833
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,930
What's up with that?

834
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,130
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

835
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,540
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

836
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,110
Man, this is bullshit! We won those games, not you.

837
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,380
That's 1 ,000 push-ups for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

838
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,750
You wanna try for 2,000?

839
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:06,140
Young man, think about the choice you're making if you walk out that door.

840
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,740
To the baseline.

841
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,020
All right. How about LaQuisha, if it's a girl.

842
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,720
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto called and they want they name back.

843
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,030
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

844
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,530
You might as well call the baby Food Stamp.

845
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,330
You're stupid.

846
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:40,070
All right, l was thinking l could call her Harmony.

847
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,210
- l like Harmony.  - Harmony, oh, that's good. l like that.

848
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,680
- What did Kenyon say?  - Please, he want a boy.

849
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,250
- Figures.  - Speaking of Michael Jordan...

850
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,850
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

851
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,680
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men, and men ain't worth the trouble.

852
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,260
Don't you have someplace to go? Something to do?

853
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,130
Guess he wants me all to himself.

854
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,360
See you later.

855
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,230
Don't forget, l need your notes for history.

856
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,630
- All right, l got you.  - Yeah. See you later.

857
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,770
l bought us tickets to the dance.

858
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,010
Why you telling these loudmouth girls about the baby?

859
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,150
Now everybody's gonna know.

860
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,910
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

861
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,280
- lt's not people's business, Kyra.  - Why you jumping down my throat?

862
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,920
What's wrong with you?

863
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,260
Look, me and coach been talking, and he thinks l can play college ball.

864
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,490
All right, so?

865
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,890
So how am l gonna do that and raise a baby?

866
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,130
l don't know. l mean, l'm not saying it won't be hard.

867
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,740
Hard? lt's already hard.

868
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,500
The kid ain't even here yet and l'm worried

869
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,840
about how l'm gonna feed it, how l'm gonna pay for this and that.

870
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,510
Everything.

871
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,870
- l'm not ready.  - So, what are you saying?

872
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,180
You want out? ls that what you're saying?

873
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,850
Go ahead and say it.

874
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,890
Look, if l wanted to be out, l would've been out by now, Kyra.

875
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,790
That's not it at all. l love you.

876
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,390
l wanna be with you.

877
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,620
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

878
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,200
l'm thinking about what's best for us.

879
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,630
You're not trying to think about what's best for both of us,

880
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,430
you're thinking about what's best for you.

881
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,270
You don't want me to have this baby. You wanna leave Richmond.

882
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,310
You wanna go play college ball. So guess what?

883
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:22,410
We ain't got to be ready enough for nothing, all right?

884
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,540
l'm ready enough to do what l gotta do all by my damn self.

885
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,720
So you can take these and go to the dance yourself.

886
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,980
Progress reports? You're the basketball coach.

887
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,680
Look, ma'am, we talked about this. l don't see what the problem is.

888
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,420
Do you know what the APl is, Mr. Carter?

889
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,960
No, l don't.

890
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,830
The Academic Performance lndex.

891
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,060
They judge schools on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best.

892
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,700
Do you have any idea where Richmond falls on that scale?

893
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,170
No, ma'am, l have no idea.

894
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,100
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have been for the last seven years.

895
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,280
The state rewards schools for their performance.

896
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,840
So every year l have less money to pay faculty and staff.

897
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,980
- Look, ma'am...  - Can l ask what it is you want?

898
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,180
- l want my boys to go to college.  - College?

899
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,050
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates 50 percent of its students,

900
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,550
the higher percentage being girls.

901
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,620
Now, in my very educated opinion, you have 1 5 players on your team,

902
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,560
you'll be lucky to graduate five of them.

903
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,560
l'm sorry, ma'am, but l don't agree with you.

904
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,560
Look, these boys signed contracts. Maybe if you'd read one of them...

905
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,240
Your job is to win basketball games, Mr. Carter.

906
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,070
- l suggest you start doing your job.  - And your job is to educate these kids.

907
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,870
l suggest you start doing yours.

908
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,590
Well...

909
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,150
...we had another good week.

910
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,700
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

911
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:50,770
But l'm on my own. You're never here.

912
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,670
- lt gets crazy.  - Look, l appreciate everything you do.

913
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,970
And l promise you... We're closed.

914
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,730
...as soon as the season is over, l will be here for you.

915
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,380
Mr. Carter?

916
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,170
- l'm...  - Junior Battle's mother.

917
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,940
Yes, ma'am, l remember you.

918
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,810
Willa. Willa Battle.

919
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,380
How may l help you, ma'am?

920
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,990
Mr. Carter, l got a phone call today

921
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,890
from a coach at a junior college in Sacramento.

922
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,120
Now, they wanna see Junior play this Friday.

923
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,660
Well, that's great, ma'am, but Junior broke some rules...

924
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,390
And l agree with them.

925
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,160
l'm not here to argue with your rules.

926
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,960
l'm not.

927
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,240
Almost two years ago now,

928
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:34,740
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

929
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:40,750
...killed, and it's been confusing and hard for me and for Junior.

930
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,120
After you lose a son...

931
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:50,250
...every time the phone rings, your heart stops.

932
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,760
Now, l'm not asking for special attention.

933
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,560
l agree he needs to get straight with his classes.

934
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,800
But the idea of junior college had never even occurred to my son.

935
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,880
Now, l could move to the Hercules school district, and he could play there.

936
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,810
- But moving is not gonna solve...  - But l want him to play for you.

937
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,820
Look, l'm not gonna stand here

938
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,550
and say l know how it feels to lose a son, because l don't.

939
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,620
And l do appreciate you putting your trust in me.

940
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,630
But l need to hear that from Junior.

941
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,760
He in the car.

942
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,270
Junior!

943
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,640
Go on.

944
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,320
l'm sorry for what l said and did at practice,

945
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,620
and l promise to get caught up with my classes, sir.

946
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,130
Look me in the eye, sir.

947
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,770
Everything inside me tells me if l take you back,

948
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,540
l'd be making a mistake and you'll make a fool of me.

949
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,650
No, sir.

950
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,150
You owe me 1 ,000 push-ups

951
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,020
and 1 ,000 suicides before you can play.

952
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,860
l'll see you at practice tomorrow.

953
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,930
Thank you, sir.

954
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,770
And you gonna do every last one of them.

955
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,030
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

956
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,640
l don't know who you think you are.

957
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,210
The next time you make a decision, you better ask me first.

958
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,880
Yo, Junior, you did your thing tonight, man.

959
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,710
- Good looking out, yo.  - Yeah, good shot, Junior.

960
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,520
- Yeah, no doubt.  - Gentlemen, listen up.

961
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:04,190
l just received a call from the director of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

962
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,730
You have been invited.

963
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,420
- Yeah!  - Yeah, baby!

964
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,300

l spoke to Principal Garrison today.

966
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,680
She informs me that your teachers will have your academic-progress reports

967
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,780
prepared by the end of holiday break.

968
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,470
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

969
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,550

Big ups to everybody who came out to the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

975
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,360
Get down!

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,570
You know!

981
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,540
Y'all gonna wanna see the look on the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

982
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,470
when the Richmond Oilers roll into town.

983
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,910
Holla!

984
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,630
Kyra, what are you thinking? You can't drink!

985
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,630
- You're pregnant, girl.  - Stop.

986
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,060
lt's soda, all right?

987
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,070
So why don't you just go back downstairs

988
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,140
and find one of your little girlies to freak with.

989
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,570
lt ain't even like that. Some girl just danced up on me.

990
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,440
- That ain't shit.  - Whatever.

991
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,540
You shouldn't be here. lf you're serious about this,

992
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,540
you need to check this bullshit. Because if not...

993
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,980
lf not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold my hand through an abortion?

994
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,150
- ls that what you want?  - l don't know what l want.

995
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,880
You so damn sure you wanna have this baby,

996
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,580
why don't you tell me how it's gonna be.

997
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,490
Everything's great, right?

998
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,320
Your cousin is 1 9 with two kids already, Kyra.

999
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,890
lt's great?

1000
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,960
lt was great when we was getting down.

1001
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,860
You ain't having no second thoughts about that.

1002
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,370
You loved me when it came to that.

1003
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,500
Look, Kyra, l can't tell you what to do,

1004
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,710
but l look around and l see exactly how l don't wanna live.

1005
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,210
Paycheck to paycheck?

1006
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,900
Dead-end job?

1007
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,450
You make it seem like everything's gonna be all good,

1008
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,910
like everything's so wonderful.

1009
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:51,180
You don't care about me.

1010
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,550
You just wanna go to college, play ball and forget about me.

1011
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:58,290
- Kyra, that's not even how it is.  - l don't care what you say.

1012
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,400
- l'm having this baby.  - And then what?

1013
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,070
You got everything figured out, right?

1014
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:06,170
So tell me what comes next.

1015
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,530
The third and final day of the 22nd Bayhill Tournament

1016
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,790
finds the host team, Bayhill,

1017
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,170
trying to win the championship against the surprising Richmond Oilers.

1018
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:43,770
Defense! Defense!

1019
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,370
Get your hands up!

1020
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,580
Get that ball!

1021
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:06,400
Richmond uses their last timeout with 1:20 remaining in the fourth quarter

1022
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,930
- and Bayhill up by six.  - Time out!

1023
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,360
Come on, man. We still in the game. Come on.

1024
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,650
Don't panic.

1025
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,350
We're six down with 1 :20 left, right?

1026
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,380
We've been in these guys' ass the whole game.

1027
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:32,780
We can do this.

1028
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,390
- This is our time, right?  - Yeah, yeah.

1029
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,660
All right, set up the 1 -4. Run Candy.

1030
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,460
Damien's gonna hit the three.

1031
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,260
Kenyon, Lyle, set a hard screen down here.

1032
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:46,090
When he hits the three, go right into Diane.

1033
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,570
Pressure the inbound pass.

1034
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,400
Suffocate that pass.

1035
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,230
l want the ball back!

1036
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,270
- Come on, baby, lock up.  - Hands in.

1037
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,500
- Let's go.  - "Our time" on three!

1038
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,770
- One, two, three!  - Our time!

1039
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,350
Come on, let's go.

1040
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,020
One, two, three, Cougars!

1041
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,850
Let's go, guys!

- Watch your back! Come in!  - Watch the screen!

1046
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,420
Make the shot, Damien!

1047
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,350
Diane! Diane!

1048
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,850
Defense!

1049
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,150
Go, go, go. Ball, ball, ball.

1050
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,120
Right there, right there. l got him.

1051
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,070
- Off him, man. Off him.  - Richmond's ball!

1052
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,000
Richmond's ball!

1053
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,460
Yeah!

1054
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,310
Kenyon! Kenyon! Hattie Jean! Hattie Jean!

1055
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:05,740
Hattie Jean, Hattie Jean, Hattie Jean!

01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,990
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1059
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,360
Move your feet! Move your feet!

1060
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,340
A foul, ref!

1061
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,780
Right wing, Kenyon, wing!

1062
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,890
Richmond takes the lead for the first time in the game,

1063
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,860
7 8 to 7 6.

1064
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,770
Slow the ball down! Slow the ball down!

1065
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,170
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!

01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,440
Defense! Defense!

1067

- That's a charge! Driving!  - Basket's good!

1068
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:28,760
The basket counts, and the Cougars have tied the game.

1069
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,600
That was a bad call, ref!

1070
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,070
- Basket counts! One shot!  - That's a charge!

1071
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,510
- Foul's on red five. On the block.  - Don't tie me like that!

1072
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,470
Coach! Please get back in the box.

1073
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,740
Please get in the box? Please get your head in the game!

1074
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,180
Give me a break!

Listen, we got nine seconds left. Get the ball, push it hard.

1079

The ball's coming to you, Kenyon. Run Linda. Run Linda.

You be open, all right? Let's go. You can do this.

Backboard D! Backboard D!

And the Bayhill Cougars take the lead with nine seconds left.

01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,850
Go to war, Miss Margaret, this is a tight one.

01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,910
Rich what? Richmond!

1099
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,880
Rich what? Richmond!

1100
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:50,350
Rich what? Richmond!

1101
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,520
Line up! Line up! Let's shake hands.

1102
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,820
That's what l'm talking about, coach.

1103
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:59,160
- Way to go, Lyle. Good game, son.  - Love you, Dad.

1104
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,850
Ladies and gentlemen, l now present

1106
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,900

1107
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,690
Hey, number three.

1108
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,890
- Nice game.  - Thank you.

1109
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:44,460
Okay, cool.

1110
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,020
- All right, come on.  - All right.

1111
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,050
Watch his door.

1112
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,520
Yo, yo. Come on, man, let's go.

1113
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,180
Load up, load up.

1114
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:46,960
Tonya, guess what.

1115
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,290
We won the whole thing.

1116
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,800
That's right, 16-0.

1117
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,670
Oh, and here's the best part:

1118
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,240
Your second-favorite man was MVP.

1119
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1120
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,610
l shouldn't tell you that. He should tell you.

1121
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,610
l'll wake him up so he can tell you. Hold on.

1122
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,620
Why don't you try their doorbell with your ghetto self. Move.

1123
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,580
Can you reach that?

1124
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,930
- Look at this place.  - Glad you guys could come.

1125
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,620
Oh, you know, we try to be up in here, baby.

1126
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,660
Yo, what's up? This is a nice crib.

1127
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,550
Know what? He must be in somebody else's room.

1128
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:57,030
Like l was saying, you know, l'm Junior Battle. l'm the man.

1129
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,000
- That's what l'm talking about.  - l know.

1130
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:03,180
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?  - Maybe.

1131
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,590
Yo!

1132
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,130
You looking for your team?

1133
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,030
Yes, sir.

1134
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,390
Oh, baby. Hard biz. Know what l'm saying?

1135
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,930
This is my style right here. l'm amazing. Feel me, Lyle?

1136
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,870
Hey, yo, Lyle. Let me get a coochie juice.

1137
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,440
l got you, dog. l got you.

1138
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,230
- Yo, Worm!  - What up, dog?

1139
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,070
- Damien!  - Yeah?

1140
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,770
l'm open!

1141
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,840
Damien!

1142
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:49,020
- Damien, are you drunk?  - No. l don't drink.

1143
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,090
- Sorry about the thing.  - lt's okay.

1144
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,760
- l see you!  - l see you too.

1145
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,590
- l see her!  - Why don't we go swimming.

1146
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,660
- We're going swimming?  - Yeah.

1147
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,390
Hey, l'm going swimming!

1148
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,560
l'm going swimming!

1149
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,260
You're going swimming with the MVP!

1150
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,670
MVP!

1151
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,980
This water's probably cold as hell, shorty. l don't know.

1152
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,530
And swimming ain't my cup of tea, baby. Know what l'm saying?

1153
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:31,630
Heated. Probably 90 degrees.

1154
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:34,490
- We don't have bathing suits.  - Right.

1155
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,690
Neither do we.

1156
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,870
Oh, so it's like that?

1157
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,770
Show me the money, then, know what l'm saying?

1158
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,710
- Damn!  - Since it's like that.

1159
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:55,290
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.

1160
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,660
- Damn!  - You are looking right.

1161
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,830
l like that.

1162
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,760
You guys coming?

1163
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,260
We're getting in there.

1164
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,860
l gotta take my chain off so it don't turn green.

1165
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,770
Oh, man, l can't believe this.

1166
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,470
Heaven!

1167
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,230
Excuse me.

1168
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:43,830
- Can l help you?  - l'm Ken Carter,

1169
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,830
coach of the Richmond High basketball team.

1170
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,800
Richmond?

1171
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:51,100
- You're a little lost, aren't you?  - Well, l'm looking for my son.

1172
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:55,040
The cab driver told me he dropped the team off here for a party.

1173
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,770
Excuse me.

1174
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,580
Oh, my God, is that...?

1175
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,350
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.

1176
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,550
You see your son?

1177
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,090
Yes, sir, l do.

1178
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,600
Damien Carter.

1179
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,670
Get your ass out of that pool.

1180
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,850
Yes, sir.

1181
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,570
Richmond High players, let's go!

1182
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,010
- Coach!  - Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1183
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,780
Worm?

1184
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,750
What up, coach?

1185
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,980
l got somebody l want you to meet.

1186
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:16,890
Now, l just met her, but she is fine as hell.

1187
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,900
- Her name is...  - Susan!

1188
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,330
- Susan. He right!  - Oh, shit.

1189
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,330
My daughter, Susan.

1190
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:30,280
You are not going to like what happens in practice on Monday.

1191
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,710
You think you've run for me before?

1192
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:37,440
l come to your rooms to celebrate with you, and you sneak...

1193
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:43,510
l end up taking a road trip to the suburbs,

1194
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,280
where l find my drunk-ass point guard

1195
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:48,790
on top of Daddy's little princess!

1196
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,860
Actually, l was on the bottom, coach. She was on the top.

1197
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:55,530
Worm, do you wanna be on this team?

1198
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,360
Because you're about six words from getting kicked off

1199
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:01,470
and kicked off the goddamn bus!

1200
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,940
Cruz, open your eyes!

1201
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:06,340
Ghetto hoop stars!

1202
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:10,270
Signing autographs and humping the honeys!

1203
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:13,580
Well, l'm gonna show you what humping is.

1204
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:17,720
Coach, we won the tournament.

1205
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,260
We undefeated.

1206
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,550
l mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1207
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,090
Winners?

1208
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,930
Oh, no.

1209
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:42,110
Oh, no, no, no.

1210
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:44,870
Oh, no!

1211
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,740
God...!

1212
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,290
You guys are awesome!

1213
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,240
What's up, Cruz?

1214
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,640
l don't know.

1215
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:22,840
Coach giving us a day off, l guess.

1216
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,210
Yo, l don't even know where the library's even at.

1217
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:30,520
- l bet you don't.  - "Library's at"?

1218
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,950
He don't know where the library's at.

1219
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,570
Quiet.

1220
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,670
Quiet!

1221
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:57,210
Gentlemen, in this hand, l hold contracts

1222
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,820
signed by me and signed by you.

1223
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:04,680
ln this hand, l hold academic-progress reports prepared by your teachers.

1224
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,890
We have six players failing at least one class,

1225
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:12,190
eight players getting incompletes based on attendance.

1226
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,600
Gentlemen, you have failed to up...

1227
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,830
No, l'm sorry.

1228
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,530
We have failed.

1229
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,810
We have failed each other.

1230
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,900
Now, there are some of you who have upheld this contract.

1231
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:29,510
But know that we are a team.

1232
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,620
And until we all meet the terms of this contract,

1233
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,550
the gym will remain locked.

1234
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,950
- Locked?  - What?

1235
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,350
- What you mean, locked?  - What, like for the day?

1236
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,460
- He must mean for the day.  - Mr. Thompson,

1237
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,890
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have generously volunteered their time

1238
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,590
to help us reach our goals.

1239
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,430
But, coach, l have a 3.3.

1240
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,000
That's good, sir.

1241
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,260
Do you score all the points for the team too?

1242
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:57,270
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1243
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,770
Do you know what Oilers stands for?

1244
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,050
Sir?

1245
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,650
Know that you're not just walking out on me.

1246
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,880
You're walking out on them.

1247
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,590
l had to beg you.

1248
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,990
And then l ran all those sprints.

1249
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:21,250
l did all that shit.

1250
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:25,600
l killed myself for you, sir, to get back on the team.

1251
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,840
This is bullshit.

1252
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:56,730
You put a lock on the gym and forced them to meet you in the library?

1253
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,460
- Are you crazy?  - Miss Garrison.

1254
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,770
l'm surprised you know where my office is.

1255
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:02,530
Take the lock off that gym.

1256
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,210
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1257
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,000
Maybe someone on the other end of that phone

1258
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,910
has a solution to our problem.

1259
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,210
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter, but your methods are a bit extreme.

1260
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,350
You painted an extreme picture.

1261
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:16,390
No one expects them to graduate, no one expects them to go to college.

1262
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:19,350
So you take away basketball, the one area of their lives

1263
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,460
- where they have some success?  - Yes, ma'am.

1264
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,290
And you challenge them academically?

1265
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,230
- Yes, ma'am.  - And what if they fail?

1266
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,530
Then we've failed.

1267
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,360
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter, both you and l know

1268
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,800
that for some of these kids, this basketball season

1269
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:36,600
will be the highlight of their lives.

1270
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:41,170
Well, l think that's the problem. Don't you?

1271
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,510
- Good morning, Coach Carter.  - Good morning.

1272
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,470
Quite the Pandora's box you've opened.

1273
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,110
Oh, l get all the blame now?

1274
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:15,180
Let's just say l'm happy to give you all the credit.

1275
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:18,610
l've got every news reporter in town waiting to speak to you.

1276
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,510
Got a press conference set up around the front of the gymnasium.

1277
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,980
Coach Carter has taken the lockout to the next level

1278
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,920
by canceling last night's game.

1279
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:29,690
Richmond forfeited the game, making it their first loss of the season.

1280
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,690
And for now, the lock remains on the gym.

1281
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,660
Here he comes. Here he comes now.

1282
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:38,030
Coach Carter! Coach! Can l get a question?

1283
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,660
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. l'd like to thank you for your patience.

1284
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,640
At this time, l'd like to introduce Coach Ken Carter.

1285
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,110
You may direct your questions to him.

1286
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:51,910
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players whose grades qualify them to play?

1287
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,810
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1288
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,350
We support each other on and off the court.

1289
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,890
Anybody still think coach bluffing now?

1290
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,750
l feel like running right up in the middle of all those reporters

1291
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,400
and telling them l think this is bullshit, son.

1292
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,960
Maybe you should've gone to class, Lyle.

1293
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,930
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog. My grades are fine, homeboy.

1294
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:13,110
- lt's Junior they should've locked out.  - Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.

1295
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:16,640
- Why don't you try spelling it, then.  - Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.

1296
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,570
- Junior, if you need help, l'll tutor you.  - Man, l don't need no help.

1297
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:21,440
Well, he ain't lock us out for no reason.

1298
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:25,080
We been tripping lately, man. All y'all know it.

1299
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:27,650
How do you think the community's gonna react to this lockout?

1300
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,950
l'm not really sure. l hope they'll support these young men.

1301
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,150
What, man?

1302
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,590
No, man, it's just funny, dog, because, Junior, man,

1303
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,990
you thought it was bad all us knew your dumb ass was failing science.

1304
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,690
Now the whole world about to know your dumb ass failing science.

1305
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,630
- Man.  - Hey, man.

1306
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:49,500
And you have Fremont this Saturday, the biggest game on your schedule.

1307
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:53,540
Now, Richmond is gonna riot if you forfeit that game.

1308
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,310
Saturday is a long way off.

1309
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,450
We'll see what happens. Thank you all for coming.

1310
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:00,180
That's all the time l have right now. l have to get back to work.

1311
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,290
Coach, have you talked to any of the parents?

1312
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,950
Thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen.

1313
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,820
l'd like to remind you that classes are in session,

1314
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,390
so as you leave campus, please do so quietly.

1315
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,230
l ain't turning the cheek.

1316
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:16,830
He come up in my 'hood, l'm serious, it's on.

1317
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,270
- Young sirs.  - lt's always been like that.

1318
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:21,440
lt's been a long day.

1319
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,630
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1320
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,940
Let's take this time to say whatever it is we want while the doors are closed.

1321
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:32,740
You have the floor. This is about us.

1322
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:36,290
Man, this shit ain't about us. This is all about Coach Carter.

1323
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:38,220
We're the basketball team.

1324
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:41,880
All l see is you on TV, getting famous, eating that shit up.

1325
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,390
- ls that all you see?  - lt's all l see.

1326
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,360
You ain't lying.

1327
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,490
Well, let me tell you what l see.

1328
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:54,170
l see a system that's designed for you to fail.

1329
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:57,200
Now, l know you all like stats, so let me give you some.

1330
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:01,280
Richmond High only graduates 50 percent of its students.

1331
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:06,650
And of those that do graduate, only 6 percent go to college.

1332
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:11,810
Which tells me, when l walk down the halls and l look in your classrooms,

1333
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:16,290
maybe only one student is going to go to college.

1334
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,360
"Well, damn, Coach Carter, if l ain't going to college, where l'm gonna go?"

1335
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,690
Now, that's a great question.

1336
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:28,360
And the answer for young African-American men in here is this:

1337
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:30,480
probably to prison.

1338
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,810
ln this county, 33 percent of black males

1339
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:39,450
between 1 8 and 24 get arrested.

1340
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,380
So look at the guy on your left.

1341
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:45,690
Now look at the guy on your right.

1342
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:49,220
One of you is going to get arrested.

1343
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,590
Growing up here in Richmond,

1344
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:56,430
you're 80 percent more likely to go to prison than college.

1345
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,570
Those are the numbers.

1346
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,640
Those are some stats for your ass.

1347
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:05,740
Now, l want you to go home...

1348
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,370
...and look at your lives tonight...

1349
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,420
...and look at your parents' lives...

1350
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:14,950
...and ask yourself, "Do l want better?"

1351
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:17,850
lf the answer is yes,

1352
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:20,250
l'll see you here tomorrow.

1353
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:22,960
And l promise you...

1354
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:27,220
...l will do everything in my power

1355
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:29,160
to get you to college

1356
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,600
and to a better life.

1357
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,960
l don't understand this. lt's a letter, how can it be a number?

1358
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,860
How are balancing those equations coming?

1359
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:07,040
- l can't do this.  - Hold on. Come on, son.

1360
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,400
Don't give up yet, son.

1361
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:11,410
Here's a story out of California that's getting national attention.

1362
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:14,440
The entire boys' basketball team at Richmond High School

1363
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:15,980
has been benched.

1364
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:18,710
The highly ranked Oilers have a perfect season on the court,

1365
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,320
but some players were in big trouble academically.

1366
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,420
And in an unprecedented move, Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,

1367
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:29,060
locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library.

1368
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,420
Now, at the start of the season,

1369
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:33,220
l understand you made all of your players sign a contract

1370
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,760
before they could join the team.

1371
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:37,030
What exactly were the conditions of that contract?

1372
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,730
The contract states that the players must maintain

1373
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,530
a 2.3 grade point average

1374
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:44,110
and that the players must attend all their classes

1375
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:46,640
and sit in the front row of those classes.

1376
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,940
Well, Coach Carter, it's an unusual strategy, and a risky one

1377
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:52,010
in a sense, in light of your team's winning record,

1378
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,350
but l think there's gonna be a lot of people out there pleased to learn

1379
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,180
that at least somebody still cares about the concept of a student athlete.

1380
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:01,160
Thanks a lot for joining us today.

1381
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:08,630
l'm sorry to disturb you.

1382
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,770
l'm Coach Ken Carter of the Richmond High School basketball team.

1383
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:13,130
Oh, yeah.

1384
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,970
l need to ask you a favor.

1385
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:18,340
My team is studying in the library, and l've been trying to tell them

1386
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,510
that brains and beauty are a perfect combination.

1387
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:21,680
Know what l'm saying?

1388
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,610
l mean, l'm Worm, baby.

1389
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:25,720
How would you like to watch the Worm work?

1390
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,850
Hey, where did you get that backpack?

1391
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:29,150
Watch out, Too Short.

1392
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:34,820
Why study earth science or history or algebra?

1393
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:40,430
Getting good grades in those subjects, combined with basketball skills,

1394
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:43,630
can get you into college.

1395
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,740
Girl, you should've bought it. l would've worn it.

1396
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,180
You selfish son of a bitch. You snake.

1397
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:01,680
- Miss...  - No, no, don't "miss" me, snake.

1398
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:03,360
Mr. Carter, you remember me?

1399
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,350
Now, after all the things that my son has been through for your team,

1400
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,750
for you to go lock up this gym like this, how dare you...

1401
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,940
Open up the damn gym!

1402
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:29,340
Let the boys play!

1403
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,120
What's up, little cousin?

1404
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,260
How you doing?

1405
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,720
Got something for me?

1406
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,180
That's what l'm talking about.

1407
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,470
Hey, hey. Put it down, man.

1408
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:00,000
- You Coach Carter, right?  - Yes, sir.

1409
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:02,610
- Yeah? Check this out, man.  - Hey, hold on, man.

1410
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,610
- Yeah. How you like that?  - Oh, hell no.

1411
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,010
- What? What?  - You wanna get out the car?

1412
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,450
- Let's talk about this.  - Ain't nothing to talk about.

1413
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:11,650
Just open up the gym, man. Let them boys play.

1414
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,650
Trust me, you don't want me out this car.

1415
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,420
Yeah, see? Yeah.

1416
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,500
- Get on!  - Don't be no punk.

1417
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:20,670
Say what you gotta say.

1418
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:22,930
- Come on back, punk.  - Dad. Relax. Relax, let it go.

1419
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,330
No, l ain't letting nothing go.

1420
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:28,100
These people in Richmond... Goddamn it!

1421
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,410
- Relax, Dad.  - Damn it!

1422
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:32,510
Relax, relax. Chill out. lt's over. lt's over. All right?

1423
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,940
He doesn't mean anything. lt's over.

1424
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:36,380
Let it go.

1425
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:38,910
Come on, get back in the car. Let's go.

1426
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:59,600
l think you know who she is, but she's got a friend.

1427
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,530
l mean, dog... You gotta hook me up.

1428
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,430
Why l always gotta hook him up? Sound like l'm the Love Connection.

1429
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,540
Just start a conversation. l'll take care of it.

1430
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,470
- Yeah.  - Yes, girl.

1431
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:10,710
You don't remember me, do you? But, see...

1432
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,810
l was just ready to duff Duke out.

1433
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,480
- Some serious shit.  - You should have did it, man.

1434
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,310
You talking all that shit, just do it. Know what l'm saying?

1435
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,350
- You let somebody do that to you.  - l let him?

1436
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:21,920
- Yo, Oscar, man.  - What?

1437
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,450
Don't go nowhere. l'll be right out.

1438
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:25,560
- l gotta talk to you.  - l already told you...

1439
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,850
- No. You guys is kind of passing...  - l know l'm fine.

1440
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,660
But l'm not feeling myself, l'm feeling you.

1441
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:35,530
Hey, l'm gonna holler at my boys across the street for a quick minute.

1442
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:36,960
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

1443
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,660
- All right.  - You know who we are, then?

1444
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:40,930
- Here they go.  - What do we have here?

1445
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:43,370
- The Three Stooges from Richmond.  - Punk, punk, punk.

1446
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:44,980
- Larry, Co and Dummy.  - Bitches.

1447
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:46,940
Dummy and dumb and dumber. l mean, what the hell

1448
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:50,550
is the bitchman from Richmond doing on our side of the turf?

1449
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:53,250
You garbage. l can't believe y'all won.

1450
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:54,650
- Shut up, woman.  - Don't be...

1451
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:57,050
l don't understand how y'all won.

1452
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:00,860
- Y'all wack-star niggas.  - Y'all wacked.

1453
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,430
Wacked.

1454
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,530
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.

1455
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:07,560
- l don't wanna hear you talking shit.  - Homey, you a benchwarmer!

1456
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,160
Get the hell out my face, whitey!

1457
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:15,970
Let's do it, homey. Let's do it, homey.

1458
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,870
- What you trying to do?  - He got a piece, man.

1459
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:21,450
You feel me right now, huh? You feel me right now?

1460
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,410
- Y'all brought a gun.  - Pinole homey. Feel me?

1461
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,920
Keep it up the block, homey. l'm right here, homey.

1462
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,280
l'm right here. Right here.

1463
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:31,350
lt's all good. Y'all brought a gun!

1464
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,960
Pinole!

1465
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:35,020
Bitch-ass...

1466
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:37,200
Pinole, right?

1467
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:40,900
- Are they serious?  - l'll knock his braids out.

1468
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:44,100
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.

1469
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,600
- Know what l'm saying?  - Appreciate the backup.

1470
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:48,210
Word.

1471
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,070
l'm gonna see y'all later, all right?

1472
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,710
- All right, homey.  - Good looking.

1473
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,310
No doubt.

1474
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,570
- l'm gonna check y'all.  - You got this.

1475
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:00,980
This is my paper, man. l'm not playing with you.

1476
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,090
Then why don't you stop getting in my face.

1477
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,660
Renny!

1478
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,630
Renny!

1479
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,710
l can't believe... He was just standing there.

1480
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:30,640
- Renny!  - Oh, shit.

1481
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:33,320
- Come on. Help me. Call 91 1 .  - Call 91 1 , man.

1482
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,180
Yo, l need a phone. l need something...

1483
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:38,150
l just need you to stay with me, okay?

1484
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,280
Hold his head up.

1485
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,670
Somebody help me!

1486
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:17,120
- Cruz?  - l wanna come back, coach.

1487
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:20,320
- What's going on?  - l wanna come back on the team.

1488
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,890
What the hell happened?

1489
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:27,300
They shot him.

1490
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:30,670
Renny. They shot Renny.

1491
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:32,840
l mean, we was just there.

1492
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:35,340
We was just there. Everything was good.

1493
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:37,680
- Come inside. Come on.  - Everything was good, coach.

1494
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,720
l mean, you know...

1495
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,250
Come inside, son.

1496
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:45,050
- Come on.  - You don't understand.

1497
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:48,590
l wanna come back on the team. What do l gotta do to play?

1498
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:50,730
Don't worry about that, son. Just come inside.

1499
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,200
Whatever you want me to do,

1500
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:01,070
l'll do it, okay?

1501
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,470
Okay. Okay.

1502
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:05,170
Okay. l got you.

1503
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:07,280
Come on. Come on, you're back with us now.

1504
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,540
l can't believe they shot him.

1505
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,440
Just come inside now, all right?

1506
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,140
- Come on.  - l just wanna be on the team.

1507
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:14,340
Come on. Come on.

1508
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:17,220
Whatever you want me to do,

1509
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:19,950
l'll do it, okay?

1510
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,000
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA

1511
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,860
for participation in extracurricular activities.

1512
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:31,130
- Yes, ma'am.  - And according to your contract,

1513
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,570
the players are agreeing to maintain a 2.3?

1514
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:35,710
That, among other things. Yes, ma'am.

1515
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:38,240
- Other things like...?  - Attending all classes,

1516
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,970
sitting in the front row of those classes,

1517
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,870
and wearing a tie on game day.

1518
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,740
l see. Mr. Carter,

1519
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:47,710
does the lockout include practices and games?

1520
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,010
And do you have a set period of time?

1521
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,090
There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1522
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,330
Please. Quiet, please.

1523
01:39:57,730 --> 01:39:59,820
That includes practices and games,

1524
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:02,300
until we as a team reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1525
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,630
Please, quiet.

1526
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,300
Please, quiet.

1527
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:09,270
Quiet.

1528
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,170
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1529
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:15,370
ln the interest of time, l'd like to open this board meeting up for comments.

1530
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:18,070
As a teacher, l was offended when asked by a coach

1531
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:20,310
to provide progress reports.

1532
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,920
Nowhere in my contract does it say that l have to do so.

1533
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,720
lt creates more work.

1534
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,190
This lockout has brought negative media attention

1535
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:31,160
that questions our abilities as educators.

1536
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:35,230
End this madness. End this lockout.

1537
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,270
l'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1538
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:40,670
That boy lives to play ball.

1539
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,900
Comes to school every day now.

1540
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:45,470
You take away basketball,

1541
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:48,110
God knows what he'd be into.

1542
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:52,440
Yesterday, he canceled the Fremont game.

1543
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:54,980
Now, that's the biggest game of the year.

1544
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:57,120
l have scouts coming to watch my boy play.

1545
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,490
- Me too.  - These boys are 1 6-0.

1546
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:03,860
This whole school, this whole community, is behind this team.

1547
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,730
Everybody goes to every game.

1548
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:12,340
Basketball is the only thing that these boys have got.

1549
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,700
Are we gonna let Carter come in here and take that away from them?

1550
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,500
- No!  - l don't think so.

1551
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:19,910
Not gonna happen.

1552
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:30,020
- l'd like to make a motion.  - Yes, Mr. Walters?

1553
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:34,690
l move that we remove Mr. Carter as head basketball coach.

1554
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:40,990
Order, please. Order.

1555
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,790
This board does not have the authority

1556
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,060
to terminate employment of a staff position.

1557
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:49,600
Then l move we end the lockout and let the kids play.

1558
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,440
l second the motion.

1559
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:54,010
- Okay.  - lf l may?

1560
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:55,540
Yes, Mr. Carter.

1561
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:57,770
You really need to consider the message

1562
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,610
that you're sending these boys.

1563
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:04,080
lt's the same message that we as a culture send to our pro athletes,

1564
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:06,850
which is that they are above the law.

1565
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:10,660
Now, l'm trying to teach these boys the discipline that will inform their lives

1566
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:12,520
and give them choices.

1567
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:17,170
lf you endorse the fact that 1 5-, 1 6- and 1 7-year-olds

1568
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:20,900
don't have to honor the simple rules of a basketball contract,

1569
01:42:21,110 --> 01:42:24,200
how long do you think it'll be before they're out there breaking laws?

1570
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,410
Now, l played basketball at Richmond 30 years ago.

1571
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:30,950
lt was the same thing then.

1572
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:33,520
Some of my teammates ended up in prison.

1573
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,980
Some of them ended up dead.

1574
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:39,120
l took this job because l wanted to effect change

1575
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,790
in a special group of young men,

1576
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:44,930
and this is the only way l know how to do that.

1577
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:48,390
lf you vote to end the lockout,

1578
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,660
you won't have to terminate me. l'll quit.

1579
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:53,270
Good.

1580
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,180
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1581
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,980
The board now recognizes five voting members.

1582
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:10,020
ln this instance, we will be accepting the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1583
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:14,190
Now, l put to those members the vote on whether or not

1584
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,190
to end the lockout.

1585
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,490
All those in favor of ending the lockout

1586
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,790
will raise their right hand when called upon.

1587
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,330
l will vote first by not raising my hand.

1588
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:29,600
Principal Garrison?

1589
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:36,010
Valerie Walker.

1590
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,010
Benson Chiu.

1591
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:43,150
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1592
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:47,360
And Ms. Nyugen.

1593
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,860
- Yes.  - Thank you.

1594
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:07,910
The lockout ends with a vote of 4 to 2.

1595
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:11,380
lf there's no other business, this board meeting is adjourned.

1596
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,550
Thank you all for coming.

1597
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,860
Mr. Carter.

1598
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:35,540
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1599
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,910
Look, l know we haven't always seen eye to eye,

1600
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:42,880
but you've done such a great job with these boys, it seems wrong to just...

1601
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:46,950
Look. No offense, ma'am, but all the work l did with those boys

1602
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:48,850
was negated when they ended the lockout.

1603
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,720
l don't think that's true, l...

1604
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,860
The board sent the message loud and clear.

1605
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,820
Winning basketball games is more important

1606
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:57,550
than graduating from high school and going to college.

1607
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,490
l'm sorry, l just can't support that message.

1608
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:54,540
Sir, they can cut the chain off the door, but they can't make us play.

1609
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:00,780
We've decided we're gonna finish what you started, sir.

1610
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,490
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.

1611
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:05,350
We got shit to do, sir.

1612
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,480
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.

1613
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:24,670
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

1614
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:29,020
lt is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.

1615
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:31,290
Your playing small does not serve the world.

1616
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:33,120
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking

1617
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:36,060
so that other people won't feel insecure around you.

1618
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:40,060
We were all meant to shine, as children do.

1619
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:43,230
lt's not just in some of us, it's in everyone.

1620
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,690
And as we let our own light shine,

1621
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:48,700
we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.

1622
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:52,180
As we are liberated from our own fear,

1623
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:55,240
our presence automatically liberates others.

1624
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:04,050
Sir, l just wanna say thank you.

1625
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:08,220
You saved my life.

1626
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:19,500
Thank you, sirs.

1627
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,270
All of you.

1628
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:10,080
Academic-progress reports, young men.

1629
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:13,090
These things are...

1630
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:15,720
...unbelievable.

1631
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:18,990
l know you've been trying.

1632
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:24,590
l guess there's only one way to say this.

1633
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,230
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal. Let's play ball.

1634
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:36,040
Rich what? Richmond!

1635
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:38,650
Rich what? Richmond!

1636
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,840
Rich what? Richmond!

1637
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:09,670
Hustle back. Get back, get back.

1638
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:13,210
Set it, Worm. Set it.

1639
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:15,650
Watch baseline.

1640
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:18,120
- Take it.  - Take it, come on.

1641
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,190
- Yes!  - Find a man. Find a man.

1642
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:28,500
Swing it, swing it.

1643
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:31,130
Go, go, go.

1644
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:35,730
Go, go.

1645
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,370
Come on!

1646
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,680
Go Richmond!

1647
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:51,050
Hold the ball, hold the ball!

1648
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:57,390
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1649
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:01,690
five, four, three, two, one,

1650
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,200
see you!

1651
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:12,940
- Great game, coach.  - Good game.

1652
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,210
Richmond returns from their lockout and keeps their streak alive

1653
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:21,720
at 1 7 games.

1654
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,190
A team that won only four games last year is now a Cinderella team

1655
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:28,590
that has to be thinking that there's a chance

1656
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:31,350
of getting the phone call to come to the dance.

1657
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:33,830
ls Richmond headed for the state tournament?

1658
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,970
So, what else y'all gonna do at the park when you go?

1659
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:51,170
- Seesaw.  - Seesaw?

1660
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:52,980
- You're gonna seesaw?  - Yeah.

1661
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:55,810
- Who's gonna push you?  - My mommy's gonna push me.

1662
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,110
Yeah?

1663
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,660
That's good. l wish l could go with you.

1664
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:03,760
- Come on, baby.  - But l'll see you later, okay?

1665
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,090
- Bye.  - Bye.

1666
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,930
How you been?

1667
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,770
Good.

1668
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:19,500
You look good.

1669
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:22,680
Thank you. So do you.

1670
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,910
Considering.

1671
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:33,320
You know, everything's been crazy, with the lockout.

1672
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:34,990
Yeah, it'll be all right.

1673
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:37,760
For sure.

1674
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,860
Can we sit down somewhere?

1675
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:03,510
l've been trying to get my head straight about things.

1676
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:06,320
A lot of things. Especially us.

1677
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:09,190
- Kenny, l...  - Kyra, just listen.

1678
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:12,150
Please.

1679
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:18,760
For a long time, it's just been my moms, my boys and you.

1680
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,530
And that's what l counted on.

1681
01:52:20,910 --> 01:52:24,470
l'm trying to count on myself now, and l'm all right and shit,

1682
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:29,050
it's just, without you, nothing good feels as good.

1683
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:34,080
lt's like l'm missing some happy part of me.

1684
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,290
l got you something.

1685
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:51,030
And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.

1686
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:55,330
Shut up.

1687
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:01,310
- They gave you a scholarship?  - Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1688
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:06,210
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1689
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:08,610
Oh, my gosh.

1690
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,580
l know you gonna kill it up there.

1691
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:13,260
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1692
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,860
l told them about you and the baby. They wanna help us.

1693
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:29,900
Kenyon...

1694
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,900
...there is no more baby.

1695
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:39,910
l decided not to go through with it.

1696
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,050
Kyra.

1697
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,420
l had a choice to make,

1698
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:49,060
so l made it.

1699
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,690
For me, Kenny.

1700
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:57,530
Well, when...?

1701
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:01,260
Why didn't you tell me? l would have gone with you.

1702
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:07,780
l'm so sorry.

1703
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:12,110
Kyra, l'm so sorry you had to go through that by yourself.

1704
01:54:14,490 --> 01:54:17,280
My mom went with me.

1705
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,650
But l think that...

1706
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:26,560
l think you should go to school and play ball and do your thing.

1707
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:28,360
You know?

1708
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:32,020
l want that for you. And that's real.

1709
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:35,170
l think you should be all you can.

1710
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:39,640
l want you to come with me.

1711
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:44,310
Kyra, l love you.

1712
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,650
l want you to come with me.

1713
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:50,050
- You serious?  - l'm serious.

1714
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:53,120
- Oh, my God.  - l love you.

1715
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:55,550
l love you too.

1716
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:04,760
Ken Carter.

1717
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:09,140
l understand, sir.

1718
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:12,000
All right. Thank you, sir.

1719
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:22,310
We're in.

1720
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,650
That's what l'm talking about.

1721
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:35,170
Guys, guys, guys. Now, listen.

1722
01:55:35,370 --> 01:55:37,660
lt's not gonna be easy. lt's gonna be a long road.

1723
01:55:38,370 --> 01:55:41,430
- We're a really low seed.  - Who did we get, coach?

1724
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:44,870
St. Francis.

1725
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:46,570
St. Francis?

1726
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:49,940
Coach, they ranked number one in the state.

1727
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:54,240
Hey, yo, Junior, man, don't worry about Ty Crane, dog. You'll get him.

1728
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:58,090
We got this. That's all right, baby. One game at a time. We got this.

1729
01:55:58,290 --> 01:56:00,190
- All right, guys.  - lt's on.

1730
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:12,360
- Bring your A game, young man.  - Yes, sir.

1731
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:47,790
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first round of the ClF playoffs.

1732
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:51,440
St. Francis is one of the best high school teams in the nation,

1733
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,510
with Ty Crane believed to be a shoo-in

1734
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:56,410
for the top NBA draft pick next year.

1735
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:59,110
On the other side of the court is Richmond,

1736
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:01,620
a team that's had a media-worthy season as well.

1737
01:57:02,050 --> 01:57:04,950
Richmond High has never played in a state tournament.

1738
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:08,490
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1739
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:15,620
- Settle down, settle down.  - 1-4!

1740
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:20,630
Ball, ball.

1741
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:22,430
Move, move.

1742
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,770
Good shot, baby.

1743
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:32,810
- Get back, get back.  - Run motion. Run motion.

1744
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:34,610
Motion 44.

1745
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:40,380
Right here, right here. Swing it.

1746
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:44,890
Force him left. Force him left.

1747
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:54,160
You gotta force him left. The baseline's another defender.

1748
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,570
D up!

1749
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:05,550
Better get somebody else to hold me. l'm dropping 50.

1750
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,250
Set up!

1751
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,220
Come on. Get on him, get on him.

1752
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,490
Get over here and help. He shouldn't be scoring.

1753
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:21,360
Get back, get back. Bring it in.

1754
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:25,300
Get back, get back. Find your man, find your man.

1755
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,530
Now, watch out. Watch that trap.

1756
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:31,200
Watch the trap. Motion. Motion. That's the one.

1757
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,180
That's it. Yes! Yes!

1758
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:38,940
S-C-O-R-E! Score! Score!

1759
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:43,420
Ball, ball. Ball, man!

1760
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:53,030
Lyle, stop the ball. Less talk out there.

1761
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:07,400
Come on, come on, come on. Let's go, Richmond!

1762
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:10,270
You gotta help Junior on the weak-side pick.

1763
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:19,120
- Delilah! Delilah!  - Defense! Defense!

1764
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,550
- Defense! Defense!  - Delilah! Delilah!

1765
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,230
- Delilah!  - Delilah!

1766
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:27,490
- Get there, get there.  - Trap, trap, trap. Left side, left side.

1767
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:43,170
- Use the pick, use the pick.  - l got it.

1768
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:49,010
- Yeah! That's what l'm talking about.  - Foul, number three.

1769
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,280
- Hold up.  - Number three.

1770
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:53,250
- Mustangs, bring it in. Bring it in.  - Count the basket.

1771
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:55,790
- Damn.  - Timeout, sir. Time.

1772
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:58,690
Come here, come here. Damn it.

1773
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:03,000
Come on, guys, keep up the defense!

1774
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:05,690
Come on, what you gonna do?

1775
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:08,800
We still in this game. Come on, fellas.

1776
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:12,940
Gentlemen, you told me you deserved to be here.

1777
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:14,700
Well, you're not playing like it.

1778
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:17,780
All season long, we played our game.

1779
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:20,380
Right now, you're playing theirs.

1780
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:24,490
When we step on the floor, every second that clock is ticking,

1781
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:26,710
we are pedal to the metal.

1782
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:29,450
We run the ball. We pressure the ball.

1783
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:34,960
And most importantly, we control the tempo of the game!

1784
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:39,800
We make them play Richmond Oiler ball.

1785
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Worm, you can take this kid.

1786
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:43,730
Force him left, and when he crosses over,

1787
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:46,970
you jump him. Damien, push the tempo.

1788
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:49,510
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.

1789
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:53,240
Cruz, when you're in the game in transition, take that jumper you love.

1790
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:56,150
Junior, just keep doing what you're doing.

1791
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:58,220
Hold on to that monster.

1792
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:01,790
You do those things, gentlemen, and l guarantee you,

1793
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:05,900
at the end of the game, we will be there.

1794
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:10,530
All right, hands in.

1795
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:13,330
- Game time.  - All right, take control of this game.

1796
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,730
Who's gonna win this game?

1797
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:18,470
One, two, three, Richmond! Let's go. Let's do this.

1798
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:24,900
One, two, three, Mustangs!

1799
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:35,060
- Get up, get up.  - Go, go, go.

1800
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:44,230
Yes.

1801
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:50,340
- Reach-in foul.  - That's the only damn one.

1802
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:54,030
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?  - Good call, ref.

1803
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:56,710
Cruz. ln for Kenyon.

1804
02:01:59,550 --> 02:02:03,010
- Ball, ball, ball, ball.  - Run it, run it, run it.

1805
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,160
Get back, get back! Everybody get back.

1806
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:21,430
Yeah! Come on!

1807
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:43,320
Get back, get back, get back.

1808
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:54,360
Ref, you gotta call that. This is my house.

1809
02:02:54,570 --> 02:02:56,630
- Push, push.  - Can we get a call?

1810
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:07,950
Take care of the ball, man. l'm gonna catch my breath.

1811
02:03:17,190 --> 02:03:18,460
Come on. Get back, get back.

1812
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:25,160
Swing it right here. l got it.

1813
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:30,970
Charge.

1814
02:03:33,010 --> 02:03:35,340
- Go get them, boys.  - Yeah, baby.

1815
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:38,450
Charge, number 30. Red ball.

1816
02:03:38,650 --> 02:03:40,880
Come on, ref, you wasn't even there.

1817
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:49,550
- Red ball, red ball. Red, red, red.  - Yes. Yes.

1818
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:51,060
- Richmond's ball.  - What?

1819
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:53,630
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1820
02:04:01,140 --> 02:04:02,630
- Red ball.  - Junior, good block!

1821
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:05,980
- l know that's a foul.  - lt's all ball.

1822
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:08,740
- What are you talking about?  - What's up, man?

1823
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:14,020
Knock his bitch ass out.

1824
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:16,150
Calm down, man. We're still in the game.

1825
02:04:16,590 --> 02:04:17,710
Come on.

1826
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:19,950
- Ease back.  - Bring it in. Bring it in.

1827
02:04:22,990 --> 02:04:25,120
Get out of my way, man. Get off me.

1828
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:29,060
Let's go, let's go.

1829
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,390
All right, baby, it's all us now. lt's all us. Let's go.

1830
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:44,550
They're standing on the edge of a cliff. All we gotta do is push them off.

1831
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:46,040
We're gonna run Candy.

1832
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:48,240
Worm, you gotta sell them the pass to Damien.

1833
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:51,250
Junior, we come to you on the weak-side seal.

1834
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:53,580
But, gentlemen, just because you deserve this

1835
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,380
doesn't mean they're gonna give it to you.

1836
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:59,460
Sometimes you gotta take what's yours. You ready to do this?

1837
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,260
- Hell, yeah.  - Let's go.

1838
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,830
- All right, hands in.  - Come on, take this.

1839
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:06,160
Richmond on three. One, two, three, Richmond!

1840
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:16,140
- Careful of the foul, all right? Let's go.  - l got you. 1 -4, 1 -4!

1841
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:19,910
- All right.  - Defense! Mustangs!

1842
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:21,950
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1843
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:26,920
Candy! Candy!

1844
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,650
Ball, Damien.

1845
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:40,130
- Move, move.  - Help, help.

1846
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,580
Get back, get back, get back!

1847
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:04,490
Junior, get back!

1848
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:17,240
Hands up!

1849
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:34,090
Yeah, that's what l'm talking about, baby. Yeah!

1850
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:29,200
Mustangs! Mustangs!

1851
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:33,920
Hold on, hold on. Let me down, let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!

1852
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:39,610
You're real, man. l mean that. All right?

1853
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:43,390
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

1854
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:58,870
Well, not quite your storybook ending, huh?

1855
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,510
Not for us, anyway.

1856
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:06,910
But you men played like champions.

1857
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:08,780
You never gave up.

1858
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:13,680
And champions hold their heads high.

1859
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:17,330
What you achieved goes way beyond the win-loss column

1860
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:19,330
or what's gonna be written on the front page

1861
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:22,060
of the sports section tomorrow.

1862
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:24,060
You've achieved something that some people

1863
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:27,860
spend their whole lives trying to find.

1864
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:34,030
What you achieved is that ever-elusive victory within.

1865
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,080
And, gentlemen...

1866
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:41,380
...l am so proud of you.

1867
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:48,520
Four months ago, when l took the job at Richmond, l had a plan.

1868
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:51,660
That plan failed.

1869
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:56,660
l came to coach basketball players, and you became students.

1870
02:08:58,070 --> 02:09:00,470
l came to teach boys...

1871
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:03,100
...and you became men.

1872
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,440
And for that, l thank you.

1873
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:12,320
lf someone walked in this door right now

1874
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:18,110
and offered me the coaching job at any school in the state of California,

1875
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:21,090
you know which team l'd choose?

1876
