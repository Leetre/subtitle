不过，问题是哪里出错了
The question that we are here to answer is

749

Winston先生，我想说的是
Uh, Mr. Winston,excuse me, but

759
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,819
只更换广告部的负责人
isn't the situation far more crucial

760
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,020
就能改变局面吗

我都没有碰过她.是天使干的
I didn't even touch her.She did it.

1496

她在哪？
Where is she?
