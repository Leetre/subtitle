1
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,628
- The tropical places, you
know, that's the go-to,

2
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,097
get your white sands and your
blue water,

3
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,000
and your fuckin' guava trees
and whatever,

4
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:38,337
and it makes a beautiful
postcard, but I burn.

5
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:40,072
And I can't, you know,
it's just not,

6
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,474
it's not relaxing to
me if I got my mai tai

7
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,576
and my pina-umbrella-whatever
thing,

8
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,613
and I forget to put on my
spf infinity,

9
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,082
sweater in a bottle,
and then the next day,

10
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:52,251
I can't wipe my own
ass without discomfort,

11
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,019
exceptional discomfort.

12
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,755
And then, I gotta stay
outta the sun

13
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,190
and deal with all that bullshit,

14
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,359
and what's the point
of being in the tropics

15
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,761
if you gotta act like some
fuckin' nerd on summer break

16
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,964
reading a hobbit book
in his bedroom.

17
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,367
So a more temperate climate,

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,771
that's what I'm lookin'
for from this,

19
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,574
from a getaway standpoint.

20
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,875
What about you?

21
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,213
- It'd be nice to meet somebody.

22
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:21,213
- What?

23
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:26,385
- You know, just somebody
new, get unstuck.

24
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,654
- That's kind of a lot
to pin on a,

25
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:28,654
I'm just sayin', I was talking

26
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:32,057
about a more temperate climate
and you're talkin' about

27
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,360
some measure of human
emotion, one of which,

28
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,362
by the way, you can find
on a map.

29
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,464
- We're just talking here,
right?

30
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:38,464
- Sure.

31
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,399
- Well, you're goin'
off like we just pulled

32
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,800
some master diamond heist.

33
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:42,801
- I'm just saying eventually--

34
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,936
- haven't even found a place--

35
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,705
- we are looking, right?

36
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:50,409
There's the check cashing
place we talked about.

37
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,411
Mm, that's a rough crowd,

38
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,682
something goes wrong, it
goes all the way wrong.

39
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:56,682
The flower shop--

40
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:01,253
- no, she's nice, and I met
her daughter that one time,

41
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,221
so that makes it really--

42
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,422
- you shouldn't have been
shopping there.

43
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,490
- I was casing the joint!

44
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:05,624
- You could've cased
the fuckin' louvre

45
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,959
for the amount of time
you spent there!

46
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,061
- She has nice eyes and she
found her passion in flowers,

47
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,662
and I don't wanna rob her!

48
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,197
Some people have no
idea what they wanna do

49
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,098
with their lives and she--

50
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,433
- fine, fine, I get it!

51
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,902
- Besides, I found the place.

52
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,238
- I found the flower shop.

53
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,306
- No, I mean, the place.

54
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,709
- Yeah?

55
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,111
- Yeah, it's perfect.

56
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,079
Unexpected.

57
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,883
- Is it this place?

58
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:31,984
- What?

59
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,586
- Oh, man, yeah, this
is like Pulp Fiction!

60
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:35,787
- What shitty part of
Pulp Fiction

61
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,022
would this possibly be like?

62
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,290
- You know, the opening part
with, uh,

63
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,992
honey bunny and pumpkin and, uh,

64
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,161
"any of you fucking pricks move,

65
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,464
"I'm gonna execute every
motherfuckin' last one of ya!"

66
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,532
- Shh, Jesus!

67
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,634
- Yeah, yeah, I'm into it, let's
do it!

68
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,002
- What are we gonna rob the
diner with,

69
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,704
our fuckin' coffee spoons?

70
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:52,704
We should at least order

71
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,275
the steak and eggs
first so we have knives!

72
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:57,409
- You guys ready
to order?

73
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,412
- Yeah, I'll have the, uh, steak
and eggs.

74
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:04,816
- What is the
finest item on your menu?

75
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:08,153
- Ooh, uh, my favorite is
the chocolate chip pancakes.

76
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,788
Super tasty.

77
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,323
- Eh.

78
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,891
- You don't like pancakes?

79
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,160
- No, it's just, uh,

80
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,130
that's my ex-fiancee's favorite,
so,

81
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,099
kind of a loaded menu
option for me.

82
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,669
Um, the Denver omelet, thanks.

83
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:28,407
- Wow.

84
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,011
- What, I don't want chocolate
chip pancakes, so what?

85
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,947
It's breakfast, not dessert.

86
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,348
- Perfect, say that.

87
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,348
- Do you wanna hear
about the place

88
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,652
or do you wanna be my fuckin'
life coach?

89
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,257
It's a house, I know how
to get in.

90
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,025
I know there's valuable jewelry,

91
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,062
and I know that they're
gone all week.

92
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,196
- Which week?

93
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,664
- This week, now.

94
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,171
- Holy shit, this is
real, this is really real!

95
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:03,842
- There is one part, um,
it's in a gated community,

96
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,645
so there's a guard and a gate

97
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:10,649
and a fence around the whole
thing, so.

98
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,717
I know how to get in the house,

99
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,287
I just don't know how to get to
the house.

100
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,558
- Well, I do.

101
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,513
We'd like to order a pizza,
please.

102
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,615
- For here or to go?

103
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:17,916
- For delivery.

104
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,218
- We're here.

105
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,520
- And that's how you do it.

106
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,599
This is for you,
my good man.

107
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:10,936
- Dude!

108
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:14,673
- You get the other half
when you pick us up.

109
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,341
- Ah, this is bullshit!

110
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,343
At least pay for the pizza, man!

111
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,778
This is all the way
the hell out here,

112
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,347
how am I gonna account
for this on the books?

113
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,248
- Fine!

114
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,453
Now, remember, this address,

115
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,425
plus a sausage, mushroom,
and anchovy pizza.

116
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,394
That's the code to come
pick us up.

117
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,229
- Yeah, the address is fine.

118
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:37,229
I mean, no one's gonna come--

119
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:42,367
- whoa, whoa, let's not get
our signals crossed here, ok?

120
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,436
Just stick to the plan.

121
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:45,437
- Whatever!

122
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,073
- Whoa, hey, whoa.

123
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,709
You know, since we paid for it.

124
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:58,016
- What if there's no
hide-a-rock?

125
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,085
- There is!

126
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,052
- How do you know?

127
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,821
- Because I know,
we wouldn't be here

128
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,055
if there wasn't a hide-a-rock.

129
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,257
- Then why haven't you
found it ?

130
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,092
- Because it looks like a
fuckin' rock!

131
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,661
That's the beauty of its design!

132
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,333
- I've got no bars, why
would you pay all this money

133
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,236
to live up in a place
with no bars?

134
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,740
I have to call the pizza
guy from inside, I guess.

135
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,409
That'll actually make it seem
more legit.

136
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:28,647
Yeah, the caller ID shows this
address, the guy picks us up.

137
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,019
Nothin' funny about that,
nothin' to pin it to us.

138
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,087
It's almost too perfect.

139
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,590
Leo?

140
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:38,590
- Yeah?

141
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,892
- I was saying we have to
call the pizza guy from--

142
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,627
- I heard you.

143
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,763
Hear that?

144
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,337
What was that?

145
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,505
- Don't move.

146
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,007
It's an alarm.

147
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,910
- Shit, I didn't know
about the alarm.

148
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,214
- It's ok, just there
might be motion detectors.

149
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,482
- Like lasers?

150
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,283
- Maybe, or infrared.

151
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,488
You know, everything gives
off infrared heat, even ice?

152
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,689
- That's fucking fascinating,

153
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,157
do you know what
you're doing there?

154
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,093
- Yeah, getting it.

155
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,262
- What does that mean,
you're getting it?

156
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,097
- I've established a pattern,

157
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,367
and I'm working within the
confines of that pattern

158
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,102
to decipher the, oh!

159
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,838
- Incorrect,
system armed!

160
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,140
- Armed, you just armed it?

161
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,745
So now we have to break out of
the house we just broke into?

162
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,047
- I mean, if anything, it proves
that the pattern was right.

163
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,918
I just went in the wrong
direction with it, right?

164
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,752
If I reverse--

165
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,120
- no, don't touch it!

166
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,421
It's fuckin' armed!

167
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,990
- I know, I'm going to unarm it!

168
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,125
- No, you're not, you're gonna
set it off,

169
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,960
and then the guard's gonna
be here in six seconds,

170
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,762
cops are gonna be
right behind him,

171
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,564
and then we're gonna be
stuck here with nowhere to go

172
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,398
because we're in the middle

173
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,234
of a giant gated,
fenced-in cage!

174
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,105
- Ok, yeah, it's not ideal,

175
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,408
but it's not a problem.

176
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,143
There's a code
and it's written down

177
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,312
somewhere in this house,

178
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,214
maybe on their computer,
in an email

179
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,284
from the security company
or somethin' like that.

180
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:16,221
We just take our time, find the
code while we rob the place,

181
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,190
and then skedaddle,
clean and easy.

182
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,895
- What about the
motion detectors?

183
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,907
- No motion detectors.

184
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,517
Good find!

185
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,552
- Huh?

186
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,521
- This place is swanky!

187
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,623
- It's ok.

188
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,192
- Ok, look at this!

189
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,697
- What is it?

190
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,633
- This is art, they have
art hanging on the walls.

191
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,369
That's some ritzy people shit!

192
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,438
We're gonna score
huge on this job.

193
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,848
- Uh, what are you doing?

194
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,017
- Stealing this,
it looks expensive.

195
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,219
- We're not gonna steal a bowl.

196
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,322
We need small things that
we can fit in our bags.

197
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,658
- Or in a pizza box, right?

198
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,293
We could put a painting in here.

199
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,862
Let's eat this fast so the
box doesn't get all sweaty.

200
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,863
Here.

201
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,567
- What the fuck?

202
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,968
- What?

203
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,937
- You just ruined that rug,
look at that!

204
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,505
Show some respect!

205
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,241
- We are robbing this place.

206
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,010
- We don't have to rub their
faces in it!

207
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,144
I mean, shit!

208
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,648
That's a nice rug!

209
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,418
- Ok, i-i don't know, I'm sorry?

210
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,054
I don't know what's going on
right now.

211
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,827
Yeah, it's ruined.

212
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,006
Bingo!

213
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:15,006
- What?

214
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,677
- Office, where would you
keep a code?

215
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,279
- I don't know,
i don't have an office.

216
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,247
- Computer!

217
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,084
Oh, maybe it's in a
drawer or something.

218
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,852
- Hey, why don't we
just go out the window.

219
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,522
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

220
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,525
Sensor, my sister has one of
these getups at her house.

221
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,959
Try to smoke a little weed at
the end

222
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,462
of a stressful day
with the family,

223
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,364
suddenly, the whole damn
neighborhood's awake

224
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:44,135
and they have questions
about your life's decisions.

225
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:45,970
Oh!

226
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:46,838
- Where are you going?

227
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:46,838
11:11.

228
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,910
- No, come on, we have
to find the.

229
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,613
- Hand me that phone.

230
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,248
- You can't just
skip this one?

231
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,983
- It takes a minute.

232
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,852
It's 11:11,

233
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,254
time for
the impossible question!

234
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,056
You guys know the deal,
but it's fun to say it!

235
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,126
$104,800, that's what
we're up to,

236
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,663
it's been 524 days since
a good soul has won.

237
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,665
Twice a day, every day at 11:11,

238
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,967
we pose the impossible question!

239
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,736
The generous folks
at black bear markets

240
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,637
add another hundred dollars
to the kitty.

241
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,839
Ya call with a correct answer

242
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,075
within 22 seconds, and you win
it all!

243
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,411
It would be so simple

244
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,546
if it weren't impossible!

245
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,152
- So
phone's ready.

246
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,421
Here it comes.
- What the fuck?

247
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,390
- Shh!

248
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,992
What were the last words

249
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,762
of the first man to
commit suicide

250
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,264
by jumping off
the golden gate bridge?

251
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,399
- Come on, that's just!

252
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,667
- Oh, wait, you don't
wanna hear the answer?

253
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,636
- Some asshole is gonna win,

254
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,938
and then the next day,
I'm gonna know the answer,

255
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,875
and then only win a
hundred damn dollars!

256
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,978
I believe I'd take
to a clock tower.

257
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,313
- Wonder how cold that water is.

258
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,281
- Huh?

259
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,016
- Those would be
cool last words.

260
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:09,254
You say, "i wonder how cold
that water is," and then.

261
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,926
- Come on, let's rob this place.

262
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,571
Who the fuck is that?

263
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,405
- I don't know.

264
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,306
- You said no one was here!

265
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,640
- She's not the person
who lives here.

266
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,474
- How do you know?

267
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,776
- Because I did my research.

268
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,311
- Then why wasn't
she in your research?

269
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,312
- She doesn't live here!

270
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,546
- Well who the fuck is that!

271
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,747
- I don't know!

272
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,648
- Fuck!

273
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,719
- We gotta cut bait, just get
out of here.

274
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:14,719
- Out of where?

275
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,722
- Out of the house,
just go, problem solved.

276
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,824
- We can't, the alarm.

277
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,660
Ah, we take a chair,

278
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,763
and we shove
it under the doorknob.

279
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,098
- And then what?

280
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,166
- She's stuck!

281
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,602
- So she'll call for help.

282
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,170
- Like on the phone
or out the window?

283
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,671
- W-what does that matter?

284
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:34,572
- Uh, ok.

285
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,977
Ha, hmm, we have to tie her up.

286
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,647
- What?

287
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,482
- Look, we need time!

288
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,619
We don't have time
if she finds us.

289
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:51,089
If she wakes up, she's going to
find us.

290
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,324
So, we have to tie her up.

291
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,477
Here we go!

292
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,152
Yeah, ok, we'll use that.

293
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:25,657
- What about our faces,
she can't see our faces.

294
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,860
Ok, we wrap her in the sheet

295
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,628
and just tape the
shit out of her.

296
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,330
- Why are we
wrapping her in the sheet?

297
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,464
- This is duct tape, man.

298
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:33,464
- So?

299
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,867
- So it's gonna
rip her fuckin' skin off!

300
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,568
We're burglars, not assholes.

301
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,172
- Fine, you go high,
i go low.

302
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,575
- Sorry!

303
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,743
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

304
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,844
- Sorry, sorry!

305
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,712
- Shut up!

306
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,980
- Help!

307
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,316
- It's ok, we're just
taping you!

308
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:51,316
- Help!

309
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,651
- Shut up, no one can
hear you!

310
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,153
- Don't be a dick
about it,

311
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,055
but he's right,
no one can hear you.

312
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:00,825
You good?

313
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,226
- Yeah.

314
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,064
- What the hell?

315
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:06,898
- Dah, my leg!

316
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:06,898
- What?

317
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,133
- You taped my left,
cut me loose.

318
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,335
- Ok.

319
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,302
Will you hold still?

320
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,670
- I'm not doing anything, he's--

321
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,938
- I'm trying to kick free!

322
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,507
- You can't
kick free, I have to cut,

323
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,242
ha-ha!

324
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,544
- Don't hurt me, don't
hurt me!

325
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,579
- Wh, oh, we're not
gonna hurt you,

326
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,914
we're just gonna
steal some stuff

327
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,117
and then we're gonna ,
oh shit!

328
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,185
- What?
- My mask!

329
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,153
- I told you not to hog the
saran wrap!

330
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,088
- I didn't see anything.

331
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,055
- Look at yours, still on!

332
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,390
- I didn't hog it,

333
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,992
it, there just wasn't
enough to go around my--

334
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,326
- bullshit, you were wrapping
your head

335
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,794
like you were shippin'
it overseas!

336
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,030
- I didn't see your face,
just take whatever you want.

337
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,732
I don't care, I'm, I'm
just the house sitter.

338
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,467
- Yes, you did see my face,
you were looking right at me!

339
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,136
- I don't remember, just
vaguely Chinese, that's all.

340
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:45,970
- Chinese?

341
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:46,804
- Dude!

342
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,539
- Turn around, Doug!

343
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:49,674
- Whatever you're looking for,

344
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,878
it's all in a secret
hiding spot, I know that.

345
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,116
All the valuables, a computer,
uh, I don't, just everything.

346
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:00,485
- Where?

347
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,521
- I don't know, I just heard
them talking.

348
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,090
- Ok, you stay here, let's go.

349
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,860
- We should put her back
in the bed.

350
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,694
- I'm fine.

351
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,528
- She's fine!

352
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,030
- No, come on, it's,

353
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,531
we might be a while.

354
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,099
- Really, I'm fine.

355
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,768
- What's your name?

356
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,635
- Darcy.

357
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,037
- Darcy, there's really
no reason

358
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,738
for you to be uncomfortable.

359
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,674
Come on.

360
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,743
- Jesus Christ!

361
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,382
- Good?

362
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,617
- Yeah.

363
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,718
- Shout if you need anything.

364
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,188
- But be fuckin' quiet
about it.

365
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,895
What are you the concierge?

366
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,431
- She saw my face, she can
identify me,

367
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,366
so I want her to feel as
good as she possibly can

368
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,068
about this whole experience.

369
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,537
W-why are you calling me
by my middle name in there?

370
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,172
You know how much I hate that.

371
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,506
- What are you talking about?

372
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,208
- You called me Doug!

373
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,077
- I didn't know that was your
middle name.

374
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,044
- Yes, you did.

375
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,946
I told you that, wait.

376
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:30,308
- Ok, now that I look at
it, I may have over-applied.

377
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,314
- So, we have a hostage now.

378
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,587
- Yeah, I know, it is not
ideal, her being here.

379
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,923
- No, it's not ideal.

380
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,559
- No, it is a problem,

381
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,429
but she solves our
two other problems.

382
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,296
- How?

383
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,898
- She knows the code.

384
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:53,898
- That's true.

385
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,969
- And we know all the great
stuff is in a secret hiding spot

386
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,872
we wouldn't be
looking for otherwise.

387
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,407
So, all we have to do is find
the spot,

388
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,645
steal the stuff, get the
code, and order our pizza.

389
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,916
- We can do that.

390
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,217
- Hell, yes, we can do that.

391
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,006
- What are you doing?

392
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,141
- There could be one of
those Scooby-doo deals,

393
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,744
where the little thing,
you know.

394
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,633
This is too much stuff!

395
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,669
- Let's start over here.

396
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:30,795
- Why in the hell would someone

397
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,831
keep a box of blankets
in the garage?

398
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,700
What's the practical
use in that?

399
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,835
You're in bed, you're cold,

400
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,005
you come out to the even
colder garage to get a blanket?

401
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:41,005
- Eh, I don't know.

402
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:45,309
- I know you don't know,
because you wouldn't do that,

403
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,445
because it's a
stupid thing to do!

404
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,548
That's the one percent
in action right there!

405
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,051
This is why our country's
in the shitter!

406
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:58,889
Hey, now!

407
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,829
If that's not a secret
hidin' spot!

408
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,032
- Oh, it's locked.

409
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:11,569
- Exactly, because there's
valuable stuff in here.

410
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,005
- Hey, whoa, no!

411
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:14,005
- What?

412
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,274
- You're gonna break
everything inside!

413
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,608
- But it's locked!

414
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,243
- So, we'll find the key.

415
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:23,914
- But we just
found this!

416
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,484
- Perfect, so we're on a roll.

417
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,328
This house is just too damn
big, that's the real problem.

418
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:37,328
- Yeah, if you're robbing it,

419
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,665
but if you're living here,
it's probably pretty nice.

420
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,600
- It's ostentatious!

421
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,735
I mean, if they were just
a little more humble,

422
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,305
we wouldn't have so many
rooms to look through.

423
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,206
I mean, what is this?

424
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,644
The fucking parlor room or
conservatory, it's like clue!

425
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,228
- Niagara Falls.

426
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,363
- Yeah.

427
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,331
- Did you know Niagara Falls

428
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,132
is actually three
different falls,

429
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,934
horseshoe falls, bridal veil--

430
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,036
- did you move anything here?

431
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,137
- What?

432
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,373
- Uh, was there any other stuff?

433
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,608
- No, I just turned it on.

434
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,878
- Well, did you
put it there, though,

435
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,281
eh, in the center like that?

436
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,950
- No, it was just there.

437
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,285
- By itself?

438
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:39,190
- Yeah, and then I turned
it on, what's your deal?

439
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:52,803
- What are you doing?

440
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,139
- I'm taking this, we haven't
found shit.

441
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,074
This fits in my bag, it's
gotta be worth something.

442
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,709
- It's just a lamp.

443
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,711
- Yeah, but it's old and cool!

444
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,080
You've seen those shows
where people find weird stuff

445
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,882
and it turns out to be
worth a bundle.

446
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,386
I saw this one where this
guy had an old spittoon,

447
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,155
turned out to belong

448
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:15,626
to some famous cowboy
or somethin', $100,000.

449
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,961
- Cowboys didn't have lamps.

450
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,362
- It doesn't have
to be a cowboy,

451
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,697
that's not the important part.

452
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,166
It's just that, generally, old
things are,

453
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,335
you know, can be, uh, um.

454
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,538
I don't know
all the specific rules,

455
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,208
but this is old and
funky and you never know!

456
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,610
- Uh, I do, ehm.

457
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,380
I'm telling you, it's worth
a couple hundred bucks.

458
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,682
Maybe three by now, maybe.

459
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,384
- Well, we'll see.

460
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,752
- It is.

461
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,753
- You say.

462
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,922
- I don't say, I know.

463
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,823
- How?

464
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,902
- Because I bought it.

465
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:01,005
- You have one of these,
i haven't seen it.

466
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,407
- No, this one, I bought it,

467
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,044
and we can't take it.

468
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,419
- Why would a lamp
that you bought

469
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,222
be in a house
that we're robbing?

470
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,794
Who's house is this?

471
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,098
- Jessica's.

472
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,999
- Oh,

473
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,102
you have got to let it go!

474
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,580
So, what,
you've been stalking her?

475
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,614
- No!

476
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,216
- But you know where she lives.

477
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,117
- That's just Facebook.

478
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,486
- You're still Facebook friends
with her?

479
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:50,988
So you've just been
stalking her online?

480
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,024
- That's not stalking,
that's what Facebook is for.

481
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,894
- How did you
know where the key was?

482
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,729
- We usedta'
live together,

483
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,231
she loves the hide-a-rock.

484
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,333
She, she used to
give it to everyone,

485
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,803
every housewarming gift
ever was a hide-a-rock.

486
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:10,307
She thinks it's the height
of human innovation.

487
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,843
- So what exactly was
your plan here?

488
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,045
- To rob the place.

489
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,280
- Why?

490
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,181
- Why?

491
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,018
We've been talkin'
about it forever,

492
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,486
so I found a good place!

493
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,255
- No, you found a
terrible place!

494
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,890
I wanted to rob someplace cool,

495
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:29,693
not your ex-fiancee's new
fiance's house.

496
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,196
- It's a good place.

497
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,597
There's jewelry,

498
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,635
diamonds.

499
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,604
- Diamonds, she has diamonds?

500
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,040
- A diamond, for sure.

501
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,409
- Wait, are we just here to
steal back your engagement ring?

502
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,410
- She shouldn't have kept it.

503
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,645
- Holy shit!

504
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,079
- She shouldn't have, and she
knows it!

505
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,814
- Why didn't you just
ask for it back?

506
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:52,683
- There was a lot goin' on!

507
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,686
We both wanted the cuisinart,
we had a big argument

508
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:58,322
about who put down
the security deposit.

509
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,657
- You've gotta be
kidding me!

510
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,092
- Neither of us even
thought about the ring,

511
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:05,362
and then I did, and I thought,

512
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:08,065
well, if I realize it,
then she realizes it,

513
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,634
and she'll bring it back soon.

514
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,438
And then she didn't,
and then I thought,

515
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,640
well, maybe that
means something.

516
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,842
Maybe she's not ready to let go,

517
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,182
and then she got engaged,

518
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:31,822
and then that was
the last straw.

519
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,626
- This is the saddest heist

520
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,361
in the long,
storied history of crime.

521
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:39,563
- No, it's not,
it's the perfect crime!

522
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,764
I get my ring back,

523
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,067
you get to steal his
stupid rich guy's stuff.

524
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,335
- Except that.

525
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,503
- That's not his, that's
hers, I gave that to her.

526
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,172
- Even better,
you get it back, too.

527
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,208
- No, look, she kept it, here.

528
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,845
In her house, with her fiancee,

529
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,981
on a table all by itself.

530
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,016
Don't you see?

531
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,719
I'm still here!

532
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,623
She's still has a thing for me.

533
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,257
- She doesn't have a
thing for you,

534
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,726
she has a thing for this thing.

535
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,027
This thing is nice!

536
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,028
- I'm nice!

537
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,331
- She's engaged to another guy.

538
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,433
- She can still change her mind.

539
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,501
I know this.

540
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,007
- So she kept your
ring, and she kept your lamp,

541
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,410
so she's gonna get back together
with you?

542
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,878
- Maybe.

543
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,779
- Maybe?

544
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,883
What about the girl up there?

545
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,084
- Who?

546
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,788
- The girl we just taped
up, the house sitter!

547
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,256
- I don't know, what about her?

548
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:43,227
- She's a friend and she's seen
your face.

549
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,829
So, you and Jessica are
gonna get back together

550
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,965
and you're gonna run into
her and she's gonna be like,

551
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,533
"oh, do you know Leo?"

552
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:53,771
"Oh, yeah, he tied me up in
your bedroom that one time!"

553
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,574
- Guys?

554
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,877
- She's not the quiet type.

555
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,212
- Hey, guys?

556
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:05,282
- Come on!

557
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:07,685
- Guys!

558
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,987
- That's not
quiet shouting,

559
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,423
that's regular, loud shouting.

560
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,458
- Sorry, I really
have to go to the bathroom.

561
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,762
- Would you stop it?

562
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,098
- Does it look ok?

563
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,366
- It's fine.

564
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,068
- Ok.

565
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,736
- She has to go to the bathroom.

566
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:26,570
- How bad?

567
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:27,838
- Pretty bad.

568
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,674
- Ok, let's, um,
let's tear a little hole

569
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,810
in the sheet around her, uh--

570
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:35,245
- I'm not doing
that, that's super rapey!

571
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:39,550
- That's not rapey, it's,
we're being courteous!

572
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,152
Ok, you have to go
to the bathroom?

573
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,954
That's no one's fault.

574
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,957
We appreciate that you,
uh, didn't soil the bed.

575
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,226
That shows a lot of respect.

576
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,428
Not towards us, specifically,
but just, you know,

577
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,666
general respect towards
humankind and,
uh, societal norms.

578
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,738
So that's a good trust-building
move, am I right?

579
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:00,738
- Sure.

580
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,476
- Ok, so, you showed
some respect,

581
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,747
we will do likewise and un-tape
you, ok?

582
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:09,747
- Yes, please.

583
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:14,351
- But just to go to the
bathroom, that's it.

584
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,520
So you can tend to your needs.

585
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,523
Then, we'll tape you back up.

586
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:20,824
- I understand.

587
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,627
- Ok, Doug, let's.

588
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,071
Oh, it's tearing the sheet a
little here.

589
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,174
- See, the sheets were my idea.

590
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,043
Didn't wanna tear up your skin.

591
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,078
- Thank you.

592
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,412
- Oh, it was nothing.

593
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,615
Anyone would've, I mean,
he didn't.

594
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,449
- Hey!

595
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,551
- But really, anyone.

596
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:48,352
- Whoa!

597
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:49,186
- What?

598
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:49,186
- I'm not dressed!

599
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:52,422
- Well, you're not undressed,
you're wearin' underwear.

600
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,590
- Well, still, that's not the--

601
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,759
- we've already
seen you.

602
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,529
- Well, I'd prefer that
you did not see me again!

603
00:29:58,531 --> 00:29:59,830
- I don't know if this helps,

604
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:03,066
but you really shouldn't
have any body shame.

605
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:03,066
- What?

606
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:07,171
- I-I'm just saying, you're
overall fitness seems high.

607
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:10,040
Whatever work you're doing
is really paying off.

608
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,875
You should be super proud of
the, uh--

609
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,310
- ok!
- Results.

610
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,711
- That's enough.

611
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,315
You're in your underwear, you
have to go to the bathroom.

612
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,351
Those are just two facts, deal
with 'em!

613
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,987
We don't care,
we're not perverts.

614
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,622
We're thieves, ok?

615
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,024
No, let's go!

616
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,170
There's a window, so, uh,
we're going in with you.

617
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,004
- Why?

618
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,439
- So you don't
run away.

619
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,274
- I'm not gonna run away,
I'm in my underwear!

620
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,010
- Who cares, Cindy birdsong
jumped out of a moving vehicle

621
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,513
on the long beach
freeway to avoid capture.

622
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,048
A little panty dash is nothin'.

623
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,182
- Who is Cindy birdsong?

624
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,450
- One of the supremes.

625
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:53,450
- Why do you know that?

626
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:58,222
- 'Cause I'm an educated person,
come on!

627
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,357
- What, both of you?

628
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,959
- Fine, I'll go.

629
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,394
- Ok, because I have to go
number two.

630
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,264
- Fine, we'll flip
for it.

631
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,098
- Heads.

632
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,209
- Hey, um,

633
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:25,649
you can have a little
bit of dignity anyhow.

634
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,625
Let's see, what else?

635
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:34,625
That'll help a little,

636
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:37,861
but you gotta give me
the mercy flush.

637
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:37,861
- What?

638
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:41,765
- Just, well, as soon as it,
you know,

639
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:45,569
hits the water, just
get rid of it, flush it.

640
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,339
Now is now the time
for water conservation.

641
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:49,339
- Ok.

642
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:54,411
- Let's see, she normally
has a lavender ,

643
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,649
people have lavender spray, so.

644
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,820
You do that, and I'll use these,

645
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:11,128
and that'll, uh, mask any of,

646
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,031
uh, maybe turn on the shower.

647
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:14,998
- Why?

648
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,567
- Just to cover up any noises.

649
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,676
Ok, good.

650
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:27,244
Uh, do you feel good?

651
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,178
- Uh, yeah.

652
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,579
- Good, um, uhn,

653
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,984
get to it, I guess.

654
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,061
My name's not Doug,
just so you know.

655
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,798
Doesn't matter what
my real name is,

656
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
I just don't like Doug.

657
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,404
Don't want you thinkin'
of me as a Doug.

658
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,911
We actually probably have stuff
in common.

659
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,851
Friends, maybe, even, like, the
point is,

660
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,724
it's a small world, that's all
I'm sayin'.

661
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,162
Hey, the system's workin'
well, though, isn't it?

662
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,765
I haven't, I wouldn't even know
that yeh!

663
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:27,404
- You guys ok in there?

664
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,406
- Marlon, Marlon!

665
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,476
- Stay there!

666
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:33,310
- Don't hurt him!

667
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:34,511
- You fuckers are letting me go!

668
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,213
- Ok, yes, just stay calm!

669
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,449
- I am calm, I will calmly
choke your friend to death!

670
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,084
- No, no, no, don't,
don't, don't, look, look!

671
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,653
He's fading, he's just, just let
us out,

672
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,156
and we'll go away, it'll be
like this never happened!

673
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,557
- Ok, all right, just let me go!

674
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,292
- Ok, yes, just let us out!

675
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:50,927
- Ok!

676
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:52,029
Wait, what, let you out?

677
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:52,029
What are you talking about?

678
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:55,699
- The alarm, just let us out
and we'll be fuckin' gone!

679
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:56,733
- The alarm's off!

680
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,236
- No, we armed it,
it was an accident,

681
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,538
so just type in the
code, and we'll be gone

682
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,373
and that's that, I swear!

683
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,680
- I saw, I saw clouds,
people made of clouds,

684
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:11,848
and they were goin'--

685
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,517
- it's ok, it's ok,
you're all right.

686
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,553
You're all right, we're
gettin' out of here.

687
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,754
- You armed it?

688
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,823
- I was establishing a pattern.

689
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,894
What's wrong?

690
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,130
- I don't know the code.

691
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,031
- Why not?

692
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,936
- I'm not the house sitter.

693
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,010
- Why would a pet need a taxi?

694
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:41,111
- It's a thing, ok?

695
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,679
People wanna get their
dogs to the groomers

696
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,816
or off to the kennel before they
go away.

697
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:47,117
- One-percenters, man.

698
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,619
- Yeah, they will throw
down for their pets.

699
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,855
It's crazy, I don't mean
that like a figure of speech,

700
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,890
I mean like!

701
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:57,160
I've seen a dog with a
collar that cost 500 bucks.

702
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,462
Can you believe that shit?

703
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:01,031
500 American for a dog collar!

704
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,901
- So you pick up the dog
and take it to the kennel,

705
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,937
why would they give you a key?

706
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,371
- They didn't.

707
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,706
- Hide-a-rock?

708
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,707
- What?

709
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,175
- How did you get in?

710
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,910
- I picked the lock.

711
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:15,912
You ok?

712
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,485
- Sorry, it's just, that's
really cool.

713
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,623
What's your deal?

714
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,593
- She has a dog?

715
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,264
I always wanted a dog,
but she wouldn't let us.

716
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,732
Now, fucking dog?

717
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,170
- Wait, do you guys know
these people?

718
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,104
- His ex-fiancee.

719
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:41,104
- Shut up!

720
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:46,176
- That is crazier
than a $500 dog collar!

721
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,913
- No, it's not, I'm just here

722
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,215
to get back my engagement ring.

723
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,818
- Wait, she kept the ring?

724
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,785
What a cunt!

725
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,989
- Hey, whoa, no,
she is not a cunt!

726
00:35:58,991 --> 00:35:59,956
- Are you sure about that,

727
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,391
because that's a straight-up
cunt move.

728
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:02,792
- Yes, I'm sure.

729
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,428
Pretty sure.

730
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,764
- Wait, so don't take this the
wrong way,

731
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:07,764
but I'm not really getting

732
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:11,601
a master cat burglar vibe from
you guys.

733
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,336
- You don't know us!

734
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,973
- I know that you turned on
the security system somehow.

735
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,543
- I was establishing a pattern.

736
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:22,012
How did you know it wasn't
armed in the first place, huh?

737
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,515
Did you just waltz in, pick
the lock, that's reckless!

738
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,551
- Because I saw them not arm it!

739
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:30,353
I came to pick up the dog,
they were hustling about,

740
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,889
he was like, "uh, do you need
to put anything in the spot?"

741
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,058
And she was like, "um, my
laptop," and then he was like,

742
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,594
"uh, it's already in
there," and then they left,

743
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:42,566
locked the door, no alarm,
it's somethin' I look for.

744
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,067
- Something you look for?

745
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,101
- Yeah.

746
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,603
- Why?

747
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,071
- So I don't get arrested.

748
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,807
- Wait, this is, like, a thing
you do?

749
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,210
- Yeah, I mean, they're gone.

750
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:57,380
My apartment's a dump, and
they've got laundry and hbo.

751
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,850
It's like a fucking
resort in these places!

752
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:01,751
Relaxing.

753
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,326
Until now.

754
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,494
Now, it's all stressful.

755
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,996
Now I need a drink.

756
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,431
- Where are you going?

757
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:14,431
- Wine!

758
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,900
- Wait, uh, we need
to figure out

759
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:16,900
how we're going to
get out of here.

760
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,103
- Ok, they're not gonna be
home for a couple of days.

761
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,640
I believe I have time for a
glass of wine.

762
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,512
- In the old days,
that alarm code

763
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:32,082
would've been our anniversary.

764
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,884
- You guys had an alarm
in that shitty apartment?

765
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:38,388
- God, no, but she used our
anniversary for everything.

766
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,858
It was her pin number,
her bank password.

767
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,729
If we hadn't broken up, i
could've gotten us out of here.

768
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,064
- If you hadn't broken
up, we wouldn't be here.

769
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,866
- Even better.

770
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:54,371
It's like she's still
finding new ways to hurt me.

771
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,972
- What are you looking for?

772
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,575
- The dusty ones, they've been
keeping those the longest,

773
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,577
so that means they're good.

774
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,612
Then you just pack
out the bottle,

775
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,547
they assume that they drank it
and forgot.

776
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,249
I mean, that's the
beauty of booze.

777
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,418
It makes things fuzzy.

778
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,187
What'd you get?

779
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,289
- Zinfandel.

780
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,625
- Ah, primativo, that's its
other name.

781
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,995
You learn.

782
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,597
- Sangee-oh-vice.

783
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,999
- Sangiovese, blood of jove,

784
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,703
it's the only grape named after
a god.

785
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,673
- That's good.

786
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:33,910
- Come on, let us go be gods!

787
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,314
- Hmm!

788
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:43,520
I stole money from the
collection plate at church.

789
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,722
- I told a guy that
i was pregnant

790
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,491
and let him believe
it for three days.

791
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,460
- I kissed my step-mom.

792
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,330
She was asleep.

793
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,198
- Did she wake up?

794
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,099
- Yeah.

795
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,601
- Ok, you win.

796
00:38:58,603 --> 00:38:59,436
- Do I, though?

797
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,137
- No.

798
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,140
Hey-hey-hey!

799
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,877
Mm, mm, this is tasty?

800
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,547
- Which?

801
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,216
- Uh, le poof le puff,
the, uh French.

802
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,089
Oh, uh, sorry, what's your name?

803
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:19,089
- Marlon.

804
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:22,792
- Marlon,
it's the other one.

805
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,160
Wait, Marlon?

806
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:24,994
- Yeah.

807
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:25,862
- Like the fish?

808
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,797
- No, like Marlon Brando.

809
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:31,634
- Oh, it's funny, I never
think of the fish with him.

810
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:36,239
I guess because it's never just
Marlon, it's Marlon Brando.

811
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,474
What's your last name?

812
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,308
- It's, uh--

813
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,909
- don't tell her your last name,

814
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,045
you shouldn't have told
her your first name!

815
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,179
- I told you mine.

816
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,147
- Did you?

817
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,281
- Yes, it's Darcy.

818
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:46,349
- Is it?

819
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,917
- The fuck, dude, yes!

820
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,185
Why would I lie about that?

821
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,053
- 'Cause you're a liar,

822
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,755
because you break into
people's houses.

823
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,923
That's not trustworthy behavior.

824
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,191
- You guys broke in.

825
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,093
- No, we used the key.

826
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,229
- You're robbing the place.

827
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,031
- Not yet, we haven't taken
anything yet.

828
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,934
- Clearly, you intend to,
you're gonna take that lamp.

829
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,003
You've been carrying it around
with you from room to room.

830
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:07,971
It's as good as gone!

831
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,739
- No, we're not taking it.

832
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,574
I'm carrying it around to
keep him from taking it,

833
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,944
so that just goes to show what
you know.

834
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,282
- Did you know Niagara Falls is
actually

835
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,584
three separate falls,
bridal veil--

836
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,620
- stop it, Jesus!

837
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:27,490
You lug around all this
useless trivia, and for what?

838
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:31,227
- Hold on, at least i
know real stuff!

839
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,762
You're the world's
leading expert in a woman

840
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,664
that doesn't even
love you anymore!

841
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,800
So, when are you gonna
put that to good use?

842
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,401
- When we're back together.

843
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,274
- It's a, it's a cool lamp,
though.

844
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,846
- Yeah, have you ever been?

845
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,082
- Niagara Falls?

846
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:59,522
- It's a lot of water, an
impossible amount of water.

847
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,924
It's inevitable.

848
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:07,263
It just keeps coming
and coming ,

849
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,998
and the noise, it's,

850
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,170
you don't even hear it.

851
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,475
It's not like something
else anymore,

852
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,177
it's just,

853
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,584
it's the only thing there is.

854
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,292
It's terrifying.

855
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,632
And then someone holds your hand

856
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,402
and her skin

857
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,272
and the air,

858
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:55,478
and this noise.

859
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,517
It's everything, you know,
everything.

860
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:06,022
You've got it all in your hand.

861
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:16,299
It's the happiest we ever were,

862
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:21,704
and she's kept me here with her,
you see?

863
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,075
So I'm staying.

864
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,147
The lamp stays.

865
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,428
I'm going to look for that key.

866
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:56,839
- So, uh, your folks, Marlon
Brando fans?

867
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,308
- Marlon Jackson,

868
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,077
the Jackson 5.

869
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,414
- That's, uh, not,

870
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,451
Michael, Jermaine, tito, Jackie.

871
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,723
Michael, Jermaine, tito, Jackie.

872
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,225
- Marlon.

873
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:17,126
- Marlon.

874
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:23,466
You should never tell
anybody that ever again.

875
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,732
- Oh, I was just trying it on.

876
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:03,966
- What?

877
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:06,035
- It's nice, I was just.

878
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,738
- Is it Jessica's?

879
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,875
I don't care,
you should take it.

880
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,445
Looks nice on you.

881
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,651
- Did you find anything?

882
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:22,552
- No.

883
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:28,157
I just thought, five
years we were together,

884
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,160
maybe there'd be one
picture of me.

885
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,030
- Well, maybe he's the
jealous type.

886
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:35,598
I mean, dudes don't
really wanna see photos

887
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,134
of ex-boyfriend's lying around.

888
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:39,469
- Ex-fiancee.

889
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:40,603
- Even worse!

890
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,407
She's pretty.

891
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,345
Look at this guy!

892
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,547
His face is too big
for his head.

893
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,883
So yeah, he definitely

894
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:58,387
doesn't wanna see photos
of you.

895
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:02,525
That's the kind of guy
who names his dog fido.

896
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:03,526
- What?

897
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:06,295
- Yeah, they named
their dog fido, no shit.

898
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,464
Like straight out of a
comic book or something.

899
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,433
- That wh, was my name!

900
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,803
- Wait, so it's not Doug, it's--

901
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,138
- that's what I was gonna name
our dog

902
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,138
she wouldn't let us get!

903
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,407
I always told her,
"wouldn't that be funny?"

904
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,277
It's like, everyone thinks
of that as a dog's name,

905
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,846
but no one actually names their
dog that.

906
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,181
Here, fido!

907
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,416
It'd be fuckin' hilarious!

908
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,955
- It'd be a unique cliche,

909
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,290
in canine form.

910
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,226
- See, you get it.

911
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,253
- Hello, beautiful!

912
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:06,589
- That motherfucker's
got a dog named fido,

913
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:08,157
and he doesn't even know why!

914
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:08,157
- Dumb shit!

915
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,527
- Yeah, oh, maybe you don't
have any pictures of me

916
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:14,697
in your house, but you're
runnin' around sayin',

917
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,465
"mm, here, fido, come, fido!"

918
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:20,236
Might as well be balls
deep in your old lady, man!

919
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:22,004
- He's your cuckold!

920
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,406
- What's that?

921
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:25,441
- It's where one guy watches the
other guy

922
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:28,477
have sex with his girl
and likes it.

923
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,512
- That's a thing?

924
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:30,813
- Yeah.

925
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,850
Mm, don't judge, it's too easy.

926
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,653
You know, you find something
that makes you feel good,

927
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,655
that's hard to come by.

928
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,228
- When you,
you choked me--

929
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,796
- yeah, I'm sorry about that,
that--

930
00:47:46,798 --> 00:47:51,033
- it's, it's ok, I just, I'm
,

931
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,372
right at the end there,

932
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,543
just as I was starting
to black out,

933
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:08,284
it was the most euphoric thing
I've ever felt in my life.

934
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,086
- Does that mean stop?

935
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:47,256
Was it ok?

936
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:51,694
- It was amazing.

937
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:54,997
- I wanna try.

938
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:55,831
- Are you sure?

939
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,099
- Yeah, definitely.

940
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:01,237
- Uh, well, maybe
we should have a safe word,

941
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,873
you know, like when you want me
to stop,

942
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,909
you say rutabaga or whatever.

943
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,179
- How am I gonna say rutabaga
if you're choking me?

944
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,114
- Rooabegguh.

945
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,215
- How 'bout I just
squeeze your wrist

946
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:15,284
really quick, like this?

947
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,657
- Kay, you ready?

948
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,961
- I have hbo.

949
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:25,861
- What?

950
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:32,435
- At my apartment,
i have hbo and laundry.

951
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,707
- Ok.

952
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,009
- Ok.

953
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,944
- Good morning.

954
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:22,845
- Hey.

955
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,415
- That was quite a thing, huh?

956
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,017
- Uh, thing?

957
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,419
- Uh, I just mean, you know.

958
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,189
- What, I don't know,
what's a thing?

959
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,891
- Uh, a night,
i guess.

960
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:39,628
- Oh, yeah, definitely
was a night, ok, yep.

961
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,032
- What are you,
what are you doing?

962
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:45,935
- I'm just trying to,
there we go.

963
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:50,473
Get my underwear.

964
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:52,274
- Did i--

965
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,342
- hmm?

966
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:55,578
- Is something wrong?

967
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,914
- Um, I just ,

968
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,987
I, I shouldn'ta
done that.

969
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,358
- It's ok, it's ok, I mean,
things got kinda wild, but--

970
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,926
- no, it's not ok.

971
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,996
Um, this is Jessica's bed,

972
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,069
and I shouldn't be having sex

973
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:22,705
with someone else in
Jessica's bed.

974
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:27,643
- Well, I mean, she has sex
with someone else in this bed.

975
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,845
- Don't make it gross!

976
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:33,182
This, it was disrespectful,

977
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,686
and I shouldn't have done that
to her.

978
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,155
- I don't mean to nitpick here,

979
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:41,423
but you didn't do anything
to her.

980
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,959
You did a lot of things to me.

981
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:45,961
- Uh, oh.

982
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:48,197
- What are you doing?

983
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,933
- Uh, we need to wash
these sheets.

984
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,368
- Oh, Jesus!

985
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,036
- What, that's just
common courtesy.

986
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:56,038
- No, you just fucked
me six ways to Sunday!

987
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,341
Common courtesy is to
buy me breakfast!

988
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:04,213
- I'm sorry, i-i didn't mean to
fuck you.

989
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:05,714
It was an accident.

990
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:09,552
- Well, that was
a long, drawn-out accident!

991
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:10,786
- Yeah, sorry.

992
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,902
You found the computer.

993
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,270
- I did.

994
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:30,372
- Why are you wearing a robe?

995
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,609
- Because Jessica's fiancee
has terrible toilet aim.

996
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:36,478
I can't find the code,
by the way.

997
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,416
I'm looking for hours,
found a lot of other stuff,

998
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:41,984
but no alarm code.

999
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,421
Whatta you been up to?

1000
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:48,657
- Um, fell asleep, the wine,
you know.

1001
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,660
I-is this all the jewelry
you found?

1002
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:54,330
- Why, do you wanna add it
to the jewelry you found?

1003
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:57,733
- No, it's just, uh, my ring's
not here.

1004
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,503
- Maybe she got rid of it.

1005
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:03,205
- What's that mean?

1006
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,608
- You know, sold it,
gave it away.

1007
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,076
Threw it in the ocean.

1008
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,377
- Wh-wh-why-wh,

1009
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:12,781
what's this?

1010
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,718
- Diary.

1011
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,986
- Jessica's?

1012
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:17,886
- Yeah.

1013
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,056
- How do you know,
did you read it?

1014
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:23,559
- I'm looking for the code.

1015
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:25,394
Morning.

1016
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:28,831
- Morning, anyone
want breakfast?

1017
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,832
I'm buying!

1018
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,604
- I'm not in here at, at all!

1019
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,740
- I noticed that.

1020
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:39,642
- I mean, I didn't expect
to be on every page,

1021
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:42,778
but maybe one mention
would be nice, you know.

1022
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,014
"I thought of Leo today
in passing,

1023
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:48,284
"he's a person that I remember."

1024
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:53,022
- Yep, some people just
aren't much for history.

1025
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:56,091
- Hold on, there's gotta be at
least one.

1026
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,798
- You looked stressed, you
want some tomato juice?

1027
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,200
- Yeah, did I tell you that?

1028
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,102
- Tell me what?

1029
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:09,738
- That tomato juice
calms me down.

1030
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,040
- Come on, man!

1031
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:14,410
Oh, 11:11!

1032
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,653
- $104,900,
that's what we're up to.

1033
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,490
It's been 525 days since our
last winner,

1034
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,592
twice a day, every day,
at 11:11,

1035
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,028
we pose the impossible question!

1036
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,331
And the good, kind folks
as black bear markets

1037
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,498
add another hundred dollars

1038
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,966
to the kitty.
- Shh!

1039
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:39,601
- Call with
the answer within 22 seconds

1040
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,304
and that kitty's all yours.

1041
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:43,872
It's so simple

1042
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:47,176
if it weren't impossible,
so phones at the ready.

1043
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:51,647
Here it comes, other
than Elvis Presley, who--

1044
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,683
- turn it off!

1045
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,218
Turn it off, turn it off!

1046
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,486
- What the fuck!

1047
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:58,487
- One
calendar year?

1048
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,122
- The fuck is wrong
with you people?

1049
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:00,956
- 10
seconds left.

1050
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:01,790
- Shh!

1051
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:01,790
- God!

1052
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:01,790
Other than Elvis Presley,

1053
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:05,461
who outlived his twin
brother at childbirth

1054
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,629
and went on to have
four number one singles

1055
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,064
in one calendar year?

1056
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:12,301
- Marlon Jackson,
it's Marlon Jackson!

1057
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,437
It's ringing!

1058
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,307
- And time
is up!

1059
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:21,043
- Fuck!

1060
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:23,178
- The
answer, Marlon Jackson

1061
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,613
of the Jackson 5!

1062
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:26,882
- Oh, shit!

1063
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,150
Brandon died at childbirth,

1064
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:32,254
and the Jackson 5 had four
number one hits in 1970.

1065
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:33,555
I want you back,

1066
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:37,459
abc, the love you save, and I'll
be there.

1067
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,698
- They're coming home.

1068
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,971
- Where are they now?

1069
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:50,839
- I don't know, she
posted this an hour ago.

1070
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:54,143
Headed home early, I wonder
what happened?

1071
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:54,143
- Who cares!

1072
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:57,613
- Why are you creeping on
her Facebook like that?

1073
00:56:57,615 --> 00:57:01,550
- I am not cree, that's
irrelevant to the situation, ok?

1074
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:04,186
They're coming home, here, now!

1075
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:05,587
- Where were they?

1076
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,422
- I don't know.

1077
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:07,589
- Hawaii.

1078
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:07,589
- Creeper!

1079
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,692
- Don't ke, all right.

1080
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:13,962
You're the creeper, always
breakin' into houses,

1081
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:17,599
tryin' on people's lives
'cause you don't like your own.

1082
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,168
- My life is fine.

1083
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,538
I just do it for the thrill.

1084
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:26,375
- Well, I had a real life once

1085
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:29,411
and it was pretty
fuckin' thrilling.

1086
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,481
- Ok, look.

1087
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,451
Hawaii is a long flight.

1088
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:38,854
They have to get their
baggage, there's the cab ride.

1089
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:40,689
We've got some time.

1090
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,891
- To do what, we either get
caught by her,

1091
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:45,394
or we trip the alarm and
get caught by the cops!

1092
00:57:45,396 --> 00:57:46,795
- I choose the cops.

1093
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:47,830
- Are you serious?

1094
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,598
- If we get caught
by her,

1095
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,167
she's gonna call the
cops, it all ends in cops!

1096
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,602
- Not if we talk our way
out of it.

1097
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:55,771
- How am I gonna talk my way out
of it?

1098
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:57,606
She knows me, intimately!

1099
00:57:57,608 --> 00:58:00,075
Oh, so, am I like,
"hey, Jessica,

1100
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,009
"wow, what are you doin' here?

1101
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,377
"We're just trying to
rob this place,

1102
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:04,446
"small world after all, huh?"

1103
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:07,416
- Ok, so we hide you in the
fish and I do the talking.

1104
00:58:07,418 --> 00:58:10,319
- Actually, uh,
she knows me, too.

1105
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:16,091
She hates me.

1106
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:18,427
- Ok, so we hide both of you.

1107
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:22,798
- Fine, so say that you spin
a real silver-tongued yarn

1108
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,134
and they let you go, how do we
get out?

1109
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,704
- I don't care.

1110
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,246
- She is not a good person!

1111
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,915
I mean, I know it's not
easy to be a good person

1112
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,583
when times are tough,
but that's how you know

1113
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:45,754
if you're a good person in
the first place, you know?

1114
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:48,457
- Yeah, I d-do, that, I used to,

1115
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,227
I know exactly what you mean.

1116
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,397
- Let's go make a plan.

1117
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,301
We dig, under and out.

1118
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:01,970
- I don't think we have that
kinda time.

1119
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,439
- Ok, um,

1120
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,641
we set a fire.

1121
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:06,475
- Where?

1122
00:59:06,477 --> 00:59:07,609
- In the house.

1123
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:08,844
- In the fireplace?

1124
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:11,280
- No, we set the house on fire.

1125
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:14,449
Lots of smoke, confusion,
and then we slip away

1126
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:17,753
under the, uh, cover of chaos.

1127
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:20,923
- Or we die in a
terrible house fire!

1128
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,091
- Ok.

1129
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:27,195
Then same idea, no fire.

1130
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,232
- What's a fireless fire?

1131
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,467
- We just go, trip the alarm,

1132
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:35,003
and, uh, hide in the trees.

1133
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:35,003
- Ok.

1134
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:38,574
- Cops come, look around,
think it's a false alarm,

1135
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:41,843
and then, uh, we get outta here.

1136
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:42,844
- All right, that's progress,

1137
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,180
but we're still inside the gate.

1138
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:49,551
The whole community is fenced
in, we're like zoo animals.

1139
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:52,054
- So we just climb the fence.

1140
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,057
- Ok, uh, if we can,

1141
00:59:55,992 --> 01:00:00,162
that would put us inside
another gated community.

1142
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,232
- I, who are
these people

1143
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:07,669
trying to protect
themselves from, each other?

1144
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:12,207
Other marauding gangs of Volvo
drivers we don't know about?

1145
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,909
- We need the code.

1146
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,010
- I've looked everywhere.

1147
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:17,012
- Well, maybe it's in
the garage, that lockbox?

1148
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:18,680
- No.

1149
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:20,582
- You found the key?

1150
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:24,086
- No, it wasn't, um, with the
other keys.

1151
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:29,191
I haven't seen it, so it
probably just, you know.

1152
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:30,258
- Just what?

1153
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,929
- I don't know.

1154
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,332
- Well, might as well
look for it.

1155
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,267
It might be our only hope.

1156
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,268
- Yeah, ok.

1157
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,145
What are you doing?

1158
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,247
- If we open the doors of the
rooms we've already searched,

1159
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,849
then we know we've
already been there.

1160
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:56,184
- We're looking for a tiny
key or a four-digit code.

1161
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:57,653
Do you think that you searched
these rooms

1162
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:58,754
well enough to just walk away--

1163
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,555
- I'm working in broad strokes.

1164
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:03,025
- Ok, fine, I don't.

1165
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:05,460
- Whoa, what the fuck?

1166
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:06,728
Whoa, watch the door!

1167
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,830
- What the fuck is going on?

1168
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:09,665
- Who did this?

1169
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:10,632
- How did they get in here?

1170
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:11,700
- No, no, no!

1171
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:13,368
- What the fuck is
going on here?

1172
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,703
- Just leave it, leave me!

1173
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:14,703
- We're not gonna leave you!

1174
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:17,305
- I'll be fine,
just worry about yourself!

1175
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:18,140
- Who did this?

1176
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:18,974
- How did they get in?

1177
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:19,808
- Nobody!
- Who?

1178
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:19,808
- How many?

1179
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:23,278
- Nobody did it, there's
nobody here!

1180
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,647
- There's nobody here?

1181
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:26,548
- No.

1182
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,852
- Then who tied you up?

1183
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,690
- I did.

1184
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,663
- So you were just gonna
sell us up the river?

1185
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:44,099
- Don't get pissed off at me
just because I had a plan!

1186
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:45,300
- How'd you tie yourself
up like that?

1187
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:46,968
- That's not the point, Marlon!

1188
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,338
- She picks locks, she ties
herself up in elaborate knots!

1189
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,041
You don't find that a curious
skill set for a dog Walker?

1190
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,242
- I'm not a dog Walker.

1191
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:54,242
- See?

1192
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:57,546
- All right, they show up,
you're gagged and bound,

1193
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:01,416
so you're just a fellow victim
of this senseless crime.

1194
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:02,584
- You're the ones who
locked us in,

1195
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:05,420
I'm just looking for a way out!

1196
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:08,390
- Devious, very, very devious!

1197
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,225
- Why are your clothes off?

1198
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,860
- Look, it was just one idea.

1199
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,296
Probably not the best
one, can we just move on?

1200
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,597
- But why are they ripped?

1201
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,065
- Again, the clock is ticking,

1202
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,835
let's not waste time
reliving past mistakes.

1203
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:27,509
If I needed to
and only if they were not

1204
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:31,747
buying my story, I might have
had to go with more of a,

1205
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,851
kind of a sexual assault angle.

1206
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:37,085
- What?

1207
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,787
- Devious, dirty little--

1208
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:41,723
- ok, looking at it
from your perspective,

1209
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:44,993
I can see how that was probably
too far.

1210
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,261
- Probably?

1211
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,663
- Definitely, definitely
too far,

1212
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,365
and I'm so glad it didn't come
to that,

1213
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,433
but you know,
there are always, like,

1214
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,668
a couple clunkers when
you're brainstorming.

1215
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,003
- What, we weren't
brainstorming!

1216
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:57,539
You were setting us up
for charges of kidnapping,

1217
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:00,242
of, uh, assault and battery,
and rape!

1218
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:01,343
- And burglary.

1219
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,544
- That doesn't concern me
right now.

1220
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:05,580
- Well, that's where
we're back to, burglary.

1221
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:06,815
- I haven't taken anything,

1222
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:10,285
so breaking and entering, maybe.

1223
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,722
- We didn't break
anything, we used the key.

1224
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:16,191
We did stain the rug, but
that's not technically broken.

1225
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:19,027
- The point is,
we're in trouble!

1226
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,864
- But trouble is
just an opportunity

1227
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:25,100
that got turned around,
am I right?

1228
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:25,100
- Yeah.

1229
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:28,637
- What kind of fortune
cookie bullshit is that?

1230
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,841
- That's not bullshit, that
is solid, deep thinking!

1231
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:37,913
- Hey, fish, uh, you know where
you found everything else?

1232
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,281
- What about it?

1233
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:41,449
- Are you sure you didn't
miss anything?

1234
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:44,119
- Yes, I'm sure I didn't
miss anything!

1235
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:47,389
I don't need the accusations,
thank you very much.

1236
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:48,623
- Worth looking at, though.

1237
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:51,726
- What, eh, wh-why are
you taking her side?

1238
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:52,961
- I'm not takin' anyone's side,

1239
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:56,665
I'm just sayin' it's
worth double-checking.

1240
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,733
- Ugh, that's fucked up!

1241
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,208
- I can't feel anything.

1242
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,042
- Told ya.

1243
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:08,243
- Get way back in there.

1244
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:09,177
- I am!

1245
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,912
- Maybe we should
get a flashlight,

1246
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,614
is there a flashlight anywh--

1247
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,850
what is this?

1248
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,052
- Nothing, it's, it's
not what you think it is!

1249
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:18,153
- What do I think it is?
- Oh my god!

1250
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:18,987
- I don't know.

1251
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,623
- All right, give!
- Oh, fuck!

1252
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:33,902
- I just didn't think you
needed the distraction!

1253
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,339
We're trying to get out
of here, y'know, so I.

1254
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,680
- Holy shit!

1255
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:50,252
- Sometimes I wake
up and think Leo is there

1256
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:54,256
in the bed beside me, and my
heart sinks when I realize.

1257
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:56,291
He used to say,

1258
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:59,361
"trouble is just an opportunity
that got turned around,"

1259
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:00,829
but I don't know if I'll
ever get turned back around.

1260
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:02,864
Poor Carl walked in on me crying

1261
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:05,467
during a documentary about
Niagara Falls.

1262
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,769
Everything, every feeling
was still right there.

1263
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,639
I wish I could just have a
tomato juice and calm down.

1264
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:12,307
It worked for Leo,

1265
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:14,042
I'd have to drink about
a gallon at this point.

1266
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:18,346
Things got tough with Leo,
and I wasn't a good person,

1267
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:21,816
so maybe I was never a good
person in the first place.

1268
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,018
I know that now.

1269
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,895
- Why would she cut out
the pages of her own.

1270
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:40,302
- All that time with
Jessica, I never ,

1271
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,772
she dumped you, left.

1272
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,609
I'm still here, always.

1273
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:52,347
We've been talkin' about
this heist for forever

1274
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:55,784
and, you know,
a little bit of excitement.

1275
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:59,788
Doin' our own thing, some
teamwork, but,

1276
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,556
now it's just the same shit!

1277
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:04,292
You had Jessica,
now you have her!

1278
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,527
- Her?

1279
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:08,296
She's gonna tell the
cops that I raped her!

1280
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,632
- I believe I apologized.

1281
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,368
- This is the whole reason
that we broke in here.

1282
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,570
- No, it's the whole
reason you broke in here!

1283
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:18,974
- This is crazy, this, this
changes everything!

1284
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:22,877
She still...

1285
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:24,279
I know the code.

1286
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,681
- What?

1287
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,052
- I know the code,
it's our anniversary.

1288
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:32,287
- No, you don't know!

1289
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:33,288
- No, I know!

1290
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,190
- No, you don't know!

1291
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:36,891
You're gonna fuck around
and get us all arrested

1292
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:39,294
just 'cause you read some
cotton candy thoughts

1293
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:40,862
in her little girl diary,

1294
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:41,997
but you don't know the code!

1295
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:41,997
- Ok, now,

1296
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,936
we haven't been at our best,
any of us,

1297
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:50,939
and maybe someday,
we'll all sit down,

1298
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:54,175
break bread and have our
apologies and tender moments

1299
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,711
and whatnot and that'll be nice,
I'm sure.

1300
01:06:56,713 --> 01:06:59,114
But right now, this is over.

1301
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,684
I'm getting us out of here,

1302
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:03,985
because I know.

1303
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:15,797
There.

1304
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,868
Now, let's go.

1305
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,704
- Fuck!

1306
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:23,872
- What, that can't be--

1307
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:26,007
let's go, we gotta run,
hide in the bushes!

1308
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:26,941
- I don't understand!

1309
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:28,543
- We're fucked, we run,
let's go!

1310
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,612
- Wait, we have to stay!

1311
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,747
- What are you, nuts?

1312
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:34,482
- No, there's only one way out.

1313
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:36,084
- Yeah, the door, let's go!

1314
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:38,853
- No, it's not the door.

1315
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:40,688
It's him, he's right.

1316
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:43,591
He knows.

1317
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:08,416
- Hello?

1318
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,524
This is the police!

1319
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,134
Everybody ok?

1320
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,687
- Oh, oh, ho-ho, oh, thank god!

1321
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:49,591
Honey, honey, the security
guard's here!

1322
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:51,426
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

1323
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:52,460
- What?

1324
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,696
- I'm so sorry about this.

1325
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,634
- Kill the alarm,
I'm on the scene.

1326
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,870
Hold the backup, stand by.

1327
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:04,873
- Oh!

1328
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,574
- Oh, god, thank you.

1329
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,943
- Uh, I'm sorry, I ,

1330
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:11,246
I misplaced the little
slip of paper

1331
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:14,516
that my sister wrote the code on
for me,

1332
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:18,586
so, god, that alarm is
such a pain sometimes!

1333
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:21,156
- Yeah, sometimes.

1334
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,594
You said miss deevers
is your sister?

1335
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:27,896
- That's right.

1336
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:34,602
That's me and, uh, my sister,
Jessica, the homeowner,

1337
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:38,506
with our younger sister
Carla and mom and dad.

1338
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:43,811
It's in Virginia
city, have you ever been?

1339
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:44,646
- Nope.

1340
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:46,247
- Oh, it's a thing to see,

1341
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:49,450
just like you'da pictured
the old west to have been.

1342
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,786
Like, it's a lotta fun.

1343
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:53,821
- Well, I'll have to
check that out sometime.

1344
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,690
- You'll have to
take me,

1345
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,626
god, he talks about it all the
time, but we've never gone.

1346
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,628
- Well, you know.

1347
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,796
You get busy.

1348
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,167
- I've met your folks before.

1349
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,270
Yeah, your dad.

1350
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:10,805
- Randy.

1351
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,040
- Yeah, Randy.

1352
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:13,942
Uh, he helped me out,

1353
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:17,445
I was havin' some trouble with
the gate.

1354
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:19,747
- Well, I bet he
loved that.

1355
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:22,250
He's so good with those
sorts of things.

1356
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:26,321
He should've been a mechanic
or maybe a surgeon, even.

1357
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,156
Anything but insurance.

1358
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,392
- Yeah, well, he, yeah,
he fixed it right up, so.

1359
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,895
And your mom made these, um--

1360
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:36,331
- I hope it was the lemon bars.

1361
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,165
- Yeah, that's right.

1362
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,967
- Lucky ,

1363
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:40,935
those are the only things
she knows how to make.

1364
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:42,804
- Well, they were good, so.

1365
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:44,672
- Well, you dodged a bullet.

1366
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,507
Seriously, I've never
seen a woman

1367
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:49,010
make more of a disaster of
snickerdoodles.

1368
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:52,180
It's terrible, but you have to
eat 'em.

1369
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:55,483
- I don't remember you folks
comin' in.

1370
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:57,485
- Oh, you know, I think the, uh,

1371
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:00,255
the other gentleman was working.

1372
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:01,856
- Leslie?

1373
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,658
- Ooh, I don't--
- um.

1374
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:08,363
- Yeah, he, he did work
the day shift.

1375
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:11,065
Normally, he lets me
know if we have visitors.

1376
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:13,067
- Yeah, uh, well, if
there's some paperwork

1377
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:14,469
that we're supposed to
fill out or something,

1378
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:16,037
we'd be happy to do it, I mean--

1379
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:18,306
- no, you know, it's just
normally, people let us know

1380
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:21,209
if they're gonna have
guests while they're away.

1381
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:25,480
- Well, Jessica, details
aren't really her thing.

1382
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:28,116
She just told us to get out
of the city for a couple days,

1383
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:31,352
and, you know, spend
some quiet time together.

1384
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:34,656
- We just
got engaged.

1385
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:36,391
- Well, congratulations!

1386
01:11:36,393 --> 01:11:38,593
That's fantastic!
- Yeah, thank you, thanks.

1387
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:41,429
- Phone's
ready, here it comes.

1388
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:43,798
What is the only
variety of grape

1389
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,734
that is actually named
after a god?

1390
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,709
- Can we get you
somethin' to eat?

1391
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:57,111
- Oh, god, I'd offer you
some soup, but, aw god,

1392
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:01,883
that darn alarm went out and,
god, it just surprised me!

1393
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:05,887
- Uh, maybe some pretzels
or chips, or ravioli?

1394
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,059
Some people don't like
eating it out of the can,

1395
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:13,261
but it reminds me of growing up.

1396
01:12:13,263 --> 01:12:15,730
- Uh, no, I'm good, thank you.

1397
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,365
- Oh,
I'm told we have a caller,

1398
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:18,866
and just in time!

1399
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:22,236
Hello, are you ready to
reveal the impossible?

1400
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:24,238
- Yes, it's sangiovese.

1401
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,007
- Uh,
i-I'm sorry,

1402
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,843
you need to speak up, please.

1403
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,212
- It's sangiovese!

1404
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:33,114
- That's
correct!

1405
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:34,148
- Whoa!

1406
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:39,987
- Oh, that is, some people
have all the luck, huh?

1407
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,161
- Man, I bet that guy's
partyin' hard wherever he is!

1408
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:49,197
- No doubt!

1409
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,031
Congratulations,

1410
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,867
you've just won $105,000!

1411
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,602
What's your name?

1412
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,170
- Marlon.

1413
01:12:56,172 --> 01:12:58,573
- Like
the fish?

1414
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:00,975
- Yeah, yeah, like the fish.

1415
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:08,349
- Uh, well, apologies again

1416
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,451
for causing all the ruckus,
y'know?

1417
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,153
- No problem at all.

1418
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:13,421
Happens all the time.

1419
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:16,290
These alarms are more
trouble than they're worth.

1420
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:18,626
I mean, to be honest,
it's kind of a letdown.

1421
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:21,028
Just once, I wanna come
in, guns a'blazin',

1422
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:24,298
have it out with some scumbags.

1423
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,134
We can dream, though, right?

1424
01:13:26,136 --> 01:13:27,769
You have a good night.

1425
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:31,672
Oh, shit, sorry, guys.

1426
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,743
I just gotta go by the
book with this kinda stuff.

1427
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:36,811
- Of course.

1428
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,448
- I just need you to
tell me the safe word.

1429
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:44,185
- Rutabaga, sorry,
that's our safe word.

1430
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:45,653
Ah, sorry, overshare.

1431
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:50,491
- H-honey, , uh, uh,
safe word?

1432
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:52,827
- Yeah, you know, the word
you're supposed to know

1433
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,595
when you're in the house.

1434
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,998
Just clears that you're
actually allowed to be here.

1435
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,899
- Mm-hmm.

1436
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,372
- You can call your sister
if you need to, that's fine.

1437
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:17,652
- Ooh, one word you say?

1438
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:17,652
- Yeah.

1439
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:24,859
- Honey,

1440
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:27,395
you know.

1441
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:43,845
- Niagara.

1442
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,917
- That's the one.

1443
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,052
You guys have a good night.

1444
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,086
- Oh, uh, you, too.

1445
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:54,956
Oh, hey, um, you can
leave that open,

1446
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,824
we're gonna head to the store in
a second.

1447
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,226
Start over with that soup.

1448
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:00,228
- The soup, yeah.

1449
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,963
- Sounds good to me.

1450
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:24,652
- Let's get the fuck outta here!

1451
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:26,287
- Fish!

1452
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:27,388
- Did you hear that shit?

1453
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:28,222
- Let's go!

1454
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:29,223
- $105,000!

1455
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,626
- Congratulations, let's go!

1456
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:32,493
- Let's load these up!

1457
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:33,327
- No time.

1458
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,161
- What about the pizza?

1459
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:34,996
- What?

1460
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:35,830
- Our ride?

1461
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:36,664
- I have my car!

1462
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,065
- Go, go, go!

1463
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,709
- Hold on, let me make
room for you.

1464
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:53,714
- You leave anything there?

1465
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,918
- Nope.

1466
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,852
No, wait!

1467
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,140
Bye.

1468
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:43,164
- Chocolate chip pancakes?

1469
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,899
Those sound amazing.

1470
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,902
- Yeah, people like them.

1471
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:51,205
- You know what, we might
be one-percenters, almost.

1472
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:54,141
You know, collectively,
our forces combined.

1473
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,477
But with this kind of
seed money,

1474
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,613
we could plan a proper job.

1475
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:01,182
You know, we're experienced
now, we can go big!

1476
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:03,217
Something with grappling hooks,

1477
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:05,920
or go all d.B. Cooper,
fuckin' legends!

1478
01:17:05,922 --> 01:17:07,521
- Maybe we could just get

1479
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:10,257
a little breakfast first, and
then see--

1480
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,360
- yeah, yeah, yeah,
of course, um,

1481
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:15,529
breakfast is on me by the way.

1482
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:19,266
Huh, I should give
this to that guy.

1483
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,002
- I'll get this one.

1484
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,872
I owe Darcy a breakfast anyhow.

1485
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:30,578
- Uh, ok,
so now that we're all, um,

1486
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,980
it's actually Kate, my name.

1487
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,318
- Devious.

1488
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,554
- Where you gonna put
that lamp?

1489
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:41,722
- Craigslist.

1490
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,493
It's our only score
from the job.

1491
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:46,394
- Well,

1492
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:48,262
and this.

1493
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,898
- What, that's crazy!

1494
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,302
Man, do they have celebration
items on a breakfast menu?

1495
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:59,573
What would that be, like
an enormous pile of bacon?

1496
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:01,575
We're goin' places, I'll tell
you that.

1497
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:04,045
Non-tropical places, I'm
standing my ground
on that issue,

1498
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:05,980
but everything else is open,

1499
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:07,782
'cause you gotta keep
yourself open to new things.

1500
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:11,452
Keep it fresh, otherwise,
you get stuck.

1501
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:13,554
I mean, you can't make a
plan to know about something

1502
01:18:13,556 --> 01:18:16,590
that you don't already
know about.

1503
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:19,960
Hold up, that's fuckin'
wisdom right there.

1504
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:21,696
Yep, I just know it.
