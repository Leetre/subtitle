1
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,060
And love slipped the bonds of restraint.

2
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,760
His touch was like a cosmic "yes."

3
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,200
"Fuck you, " screamed Kelly. "Fuck you to hell."

4
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,580
Scott stepped back from the cell door as the gob of spit flew. "Fuck you."

5
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,920
This matrix is what Hardy meant by "the ache of modernism."

6
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,680
Crap.

7
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,380
Inchcombe knew too well the dreadful mundanity of murder.

8
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,620
But Patel was stricken.

9
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,240
Inchcombe realized his lack of feeling was almost...

10
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,340
Pathological.

11
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,900
"'I've been wearing the wrong size all my life,' says Katie.

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,710
'I was always popping out. Turns out I'm a 30 GG,' she says.

13
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,850
'Now my bras finally fit.

14
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,520
Though Simon prefers me without one."'

15
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,130
We can go round mine, if you like.

16
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,460
And watch your dad farting into a sofa?

17
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
A taxi?

18
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,300
In Ewedown?

19
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,750
- Come on.  - Where are we going?

20
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,910
Nowhere.

21
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,230
- Glen, can I tempt you?  - Oh, wow, thank you.

22
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,590
Uh, I often take something snack y to Nicholas this time of day.

23
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,600
- I know how the brain needs feeding.  - Mm.

24
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,900
So how you settling in?

25
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,130
Great.

26
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,400
The last writers' retreat I was at, I kind of froze my balls off, you know?

27
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,980
Screeching fire doors and curried lasagna,

28
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,710
and a needy poet, from whom I still bear the scars.

29
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,650
Well, we try to keep it peaceful here. Far from the madding crowd.

30
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,320
- May I?  - Oh.

31
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,620
Well, it's paradise.

32
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,100
In Ewedown? What are you doing there?

33
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,700
I haven't told her yet.

34
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,390
Why not? You keep saying you want to be with me.

35
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,270
Well, I can't tell her just like that. It's 25 years. A marriage.

36
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,680
Ah. Come on, Nicholas.

37
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,250
Or I'm gonna get in a taxi and find your farm.

38
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,580
- No.  - Come up there and I'll drag you out.

39
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,910
No, don't.

40
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,990
I wanted to be with you. I thought you'd be pleased.

41
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,720
Well, of course I'm pleased.

42
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,100
Nadia, go to the pub and stay there. I'll come when I can.

43
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,760
Are you going to tell her?

44
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,600
Just give me a couple of hours.

45
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,230
Cock pie.

46
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,340
- How's the worker?  - Good, actually.

47
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,410
Just about to embark on forensics.

48
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,780
Well, give me your pages and I'll get started.

49
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,080
Reckon I might pack it in a bit early today.

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,310
Need to think about my blood smears.

51
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,050
Might take a drive, have a pint.

52
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,280
Stir the old grey matter up.

53
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,760
Who were you talking to just then?

54
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,390
Judy. She said the Impala contract should be through in a day or two.

55
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,300
I could come with you.

56
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,990
- What?  - For a drive.

57
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,870
I don't know when we last went out.

58
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,510
Mm. This is absolutely yummy.

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,870
Or we could go into Hadditon, get a meal.

60
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,480
Yes.

61
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,840
But what about the guests?

62
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,350
Mary's got Casey to help.

63
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,250
But I... I'm supposed to be thinking, you know, about...

64
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,910
You can run it by me. I'm good at forensics.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,490
Andy, can I tempt you?

66
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,840
Oh, uh, we've got a new academic. Glen, American.

67
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,100
Turns out he's working on Thomas Hardy.

68
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,650
Said he might have some farming questions.

69
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,440
- Needs an expert yokel, does he?  - Would you mind?

70
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,140
Oh, and the... The writers are eating alfresco tonight.

71
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,480
Could you check there's no bird shit on the seats? Sorry.

72
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,020
You okay?

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,590
Yes.

74
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,420
Nicholas and I are going out to dinner.

75
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,700
Now.

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,280
Fucking bingo.

77
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,060
What a dump.

78
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,520
- Yeah.  - We could walk up the garage.

79
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh. I'm supposed to be helping my mom up at Stonefield.

80
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,570
- They keep you busy.  - Yeah.

81
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,210
You never stop, you.

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,910
Bet them writers are wankers.

83
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,010
It was called From Hearth to Heath:

84
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,780
The Doomsday and Revelation in Victorian Verse.

85
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,980
What was it about?

86
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,320
Well, you know, pale poets on laudanum and dark towers and sunless seas.

87
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,480
A little Sturm und Drang in a teacup.

88
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,720
Did it sell?

89
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,330
Well, of course, my kind of books aren't about sales, that's not why I write. So, no.

90
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,470
So, what are you working on next?

91
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,970
Thomas Hardy.

92
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,300
Is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore?

93
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,140
Excuse me, but there's nothing dull about Hardy. That is a misconception.

94
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,110
At least you've been published. I'm seething with envy.

95
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,690
- I'd love to be published.  - I publish myself on the Internet.

96
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,320
- Oh, do you earn money doing that?  - No.

97
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,290
- What do you write?  - Lesbian crime.

98
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,100
I'm here picking up tips from the master.

99
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,900
- Beth?  - Yeah?

100
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,200
Why don't I just pop out on my own?

101
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,400
Well, I'm ready now. Come on.

102
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,210
Is that..?

103
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,580
I mean, are you wearing that?

104
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,650
Oh.

105
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,510
It just looks a bit hot.

106
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,130
You know, Hadditon's always packed with pissed Londonites on a Friday.

107
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,760
I doubt we get a table anyway.

108
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,420
Let's do it properly next week. Make an occasion.

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,090
I'm always taking you for granted. I'm vile, I know.

110
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,830
You should kick me, really.

111
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,640
Who is she?

112
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,510
What?

113
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,110
Oh, come on, Beth.

114
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,170
Tell me who.

115
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,550
Look, it's nothing.

116
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,580
It's been once or twice, that's all. It's just...

117
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,650
- Beth, it's not anything.  - Who is she?

118
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,390
So she's on her way in, the bride and groom are...

119
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,330
- Just a researcher on Radio 4.  - What's her name?

120
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,060
- Nadia. Nadia Patel. Patel?  - She's in your book.

121
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,370
No. No. I met her when I was on Desert Is land Discs.

122
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,530
- You put her in your book.  - Well, just the name.

123
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,340
- Desert Is land Discs was a year ago.  - Yes...

124
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,540
So "once or twice"?

125
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,980
- I was going to tell you.  - Ha-ha!

126
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,980
- In the book, from your woman.  - Shh! Shh!

127
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,020
saying that they're coming to the par...

128
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,350
- I've had enough of this.  - Beth. I'm a ruin, I know.

129
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,750
But I've been in a real state about this.

130
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,190
- I... I didn't want to hurt you.  - Oh!

131
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,060
How could you lie to my face?

132
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,670
Can we talk calmly? There are people out there.

133
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,530
You looked me in the face and lied.

134
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,730
For God's sake, we're surrounded by novelists.

135
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,270
- You bastard.  - Beth,

136
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,270
- we're like a pair of compasses.  - Oh, don't you dare.

137
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,270
joined solidly at the top,

138
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,310
but with the ends able to roam in freedom.

139
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,650
That's her, isn't it? Are you keeping her waiting?

140
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,720
We've talked a lot about the creative mind,

141
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,220
and we agreed it needs a certain freedom to explore.

142
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,860
Take your freedom. I can't live like this any more.

143
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,430
- It makes me feel worthless.  - Calm yourself down.

144
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,530
Go set up home with Patel. See if she does your tax returns.

145
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,670
Do you love her? Is she young?

146
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,530
- For heaven's sake...  - Is she?!

147
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,610
Yes!

148
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,410
If you leave here tonight to be with her, don't come back.

149
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,510
Beth, you're making fools of us both.

150
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,690
Liar!

151
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,430
Fuck.

152
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,690
I didn't know they provided material too.

153
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,450
Beth does everything for him, you know. Types his manuscript,

154
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,750
deals with his agent, makes his female characters convincing.

155
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,220
She even came up with the name Dr. Inchcombe.

156
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,760
No wonder he's bored.

157
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,520
I hope she takes him to the fucking cleaners.

158
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,540
At the end of the day, this is why I'm glad I'm single.

159
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,250
Will she take him back though? That's the question.

160
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,490
- Would you?  - Well, I'd be torn.

161
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,570
He's far too up himself. Yeah, but what about their farm?

162
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,230
Splitting up all this? Must be worth a fortune.

163
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,140
Nadia Patel.

164
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,240
"Gazelle eyes. " "Tantric sex."

165
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,240
She's very rash, making him choose.

166
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,710
Why would he choose me?

167
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,890
- I thought you weren't going to come.  - I was busy. Rowing with my wife.

168
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,360
- Where are we going?  - Home.

169
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,690
To your farm?

170
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,300
We could have gone on just as we were.

171
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,500
Yes, but you said you wanted to be with me.

172
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,010
Yes. In London.

173
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,780
Now and then.

174
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,390
Big glass of Rioja, please. And I need a room.

175
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,290
Sure. How many nights?

176
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,560
Don't know. Just one?

177
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,830
- Are you here for the writers' retreat?  - No, but I'm a writer.

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,300
Well, journalist.

179
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,140
I don't mean to pry. I'm just really nosey.

180
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,140
I'm from here. Sort of.

181
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,370
Well, it's a nice place. I love it.

182
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,150
I keep meaning to leave, but... Hard to get away.

183
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,220
My mom's house is just up the road.

184
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,590
- You're not staying with her?  - She's... She died.

185
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,590
Have that on me.

186
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,160
And here's your key.

187
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,630
Up the stairs, right in front. You can't miss it.

188
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,330
Thanks.

189
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,370
Didn't think I'd see you tonight.

190
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,950
- Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield.  - Tell me everything.

191
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,550
Marriage. Remind me never to try it.

192
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,160
Andy, you're just a sex object. No one would have you.

193
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,650
Ahem. So the Hardiments have lived here for centuries, huh?

194
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,990
No. About 20 years.

195
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,090
Still strangers, by local standards.

196
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,170
Andy, uh, come look at Ingrid. I, uh...

197
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,710
I think she's coming into heat.

198
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,670
She's very nice, Beth.

199
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,650
Yeah. I owe her a lot.

200
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,890
Husband's kind of a sleaze bag, huh?

201
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,480
We'd say "prick" here, actually.

202
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,220
Or wanker.

203
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,460
That's good. We might even call him a fuck.

204
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,360
That's good too.

205
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,000
- Can I help?  - It's going rotten underneath.

206
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,410
- Can I have a look at Ingrid?  - Look, it's... It's falling apart.

207
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,450
Yeah, well, I can do that. Beth...

208
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,810
He won't last five minutes.

209
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,300
Oh, Jesus. He's been translated into Icelandic and Swahili.

210
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,700
What an output.

211
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,110
I need my book to be a success.

212
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,450
I need a tiny reward for all my endeavors.

213
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,460
I need a dump.

214
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,340
- Beth.  - No, don't touch me.

215
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,070
- Don't you dare.  - I'm sorry.

216
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,410
- Not good enough, not any more.  - I'm sorry.

217
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,640
You do what you like, then you're sorry?

218
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,450
I hate myself. I hate myself.

219
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,350
Where were you?

220
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,160
I drove her back to London. Took all night.

221
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,990
- You drove her home?  - I finished it. She was in a state.

222
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,670
- So it's over?  - I'm sorry.

223
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,910
I don't know why I'm like this.

224
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,640
I couldn't manage without you.

225
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,370
I've got to go to the bottle bank.

226
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,940
Okay.

227
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,210
- Let's talk later.  - Yeah.

228
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,340
- The goat's come into heat.  - Has it?

229
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,180
I love you so much.

230
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,920
Me too.

231
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,790
I've just seen the Hardiments kiss and make up.

232
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,080
- The hat's on.  - Looks like she's taking him back.

233
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,560
When the hat's on, it means don't speak.

234
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,830
So peace is restored.

235
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,660
Oh, for fuck's sake!

236
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,010
- I don't like cows.  - Yeah.

237
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,170
- They exude bovine malice.  - Yeah.

238
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,540
These girls are killing machines.

239
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,110
- They don't like Americans either.  - Very funny.

240
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,010
It's Winnards Farm.

241
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,490
Lady there died a while back. Place is empty.

242
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,780
- Think it's being robbed?  - Nah.

243
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,820
Probably just kids.

244
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,120
Nothing to do around here except make trouble.

245
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,230
What if it's bad guys?

246
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,370
Don't you have a blunderbuss or a fowling piece or something?

247
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,430
Used to belong to my dad, this place.

248
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,210
- Really?  - But it all went tits up.

249
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,820
The land was flogged to a consortium and the house sold to Londoners.

250
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,790
- The Drewes.  - So this is your ancestral pile?

251
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,510
Was.

252
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,920
Born in that room up there.

253
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,850
You must have been pretty resentful.

254
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,400
Oil This farm's mine, big nose.

255
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,640
- Hey, what are you doing?  - Who are you?

256
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,340
Andy, you moron. It's me.

257
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,050
Tam?

258
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,350
I didn't even recognize you.

259
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,390
Well, you won't do it that way.

260
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,320
Then help me.

261
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,990
Used to do bits of work for your mom.

262
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,030
Been keeping an eye on the place since she died.

263
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,530
What kind of work, graphics?

264
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,140
- No, I do horticulture now.  - You're a gardener?

265
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,070
Wow, this is a great old house.

266
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,330
Thanks. Do you want to buy it?

267
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,910
I'm not the property-owning type, no. I prefer my life to fit in hand luggage.

268
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,570
- That why you're back, to flog it?  - Yep.

269
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,220
Make a nice second home for some banker wankers.

270
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,920
Look, Andy, if you want it, why don't you just make me an offer?

271
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,520
Because, sadly, I'm still prey to the economic forces

272
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,930
that threw the peasant classes off the land.

273
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,160
Unlucky.

274
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,030
Tam.

275
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,370
What the fuck have you done to your nose?

276
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,380
Oh, come on, Andy. Aliens came and took it.

277
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,840
She's completely different.

278
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,810
What was she like before? What's the story?

279
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,580
- There isn't one.  - Oh, come on.

280
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,950
It was nothing. Decade ago. Just a teenage thing.

281
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,350
You should find someone you're in love with.

282
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,860
- Stupid prick.  - You saying you love me, frosty tits?

283
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,020
- You first.  - You're the girl, you say it.

284
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,430
I love you.

285
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Fuck off. I love you!

286
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,240
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

287
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,780
Something classy in the wood shed, huh? Heh.

288
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,420
- Would you do him?  - No.

289
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,580
- What about him?  - He's gay, you dobbin.

290
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,960
- So?  - Oh.

291
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,220
Swipe.

292
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,460
Ben Sergeant. I'd walk through fire to do him.

293
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,830
- The drummer?  - He's not just the drummer.

294
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,500
He writes all the lyrics. It's his band. He's the fucking genius.

295
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,300
Not Steve Culley, or any of these wankers. It's Ben.

296
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,640
Okay, yeah. I... I'd do Ben.

297
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,750
I wanna be her, in that dress, with him licking my teapot lids.

298
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,650
Yeah, me too.

299
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,090
So has the muse shone on you, Greg?

300
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,230
I've been pretty distracted most recently

301
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,130
by those delicious cookie things Beth brought around this afternoon.

302
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,270
Oh, yes. Of course, we call them biscuits here.

303
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,530
And by the place itself, the people.

304
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,900
I sometimes wish I could get distracted.

305
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,970
Ten-page-a-day man, rain or shine.

306
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,870
Wow. That's scary. Ten pages a day, how do you do that?

307
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,450
- Oh, Greg,  - Glen.

308
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,880
I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips.

309
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,750
Matter of fact, I read one of your books...

310
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,950
Another distraction. ...I thought it was decent stuff.

311
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,020
Well, how do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg.

312
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,460
"We call them biscuits here."

313
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,660
- To the muse.  - The muse.

314
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,890
However you find her.

315
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,830
Cheers.

316
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,040
Who's that?

317
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,140
That's Tamara Drewe.

318
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,650
- No, it isn't.  - I met her with Andy.

319
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,490
Good God, what's happened to her? She had a nose job, Dad.

320
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,290
She's completely different.

321
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,550
That's what Andy said.

322
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,560
Poor Tamara, she's such a sad girl.

323
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,460
She used to come help you wash the car, didn't she, Nicholas?

324
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,960
When she was a teenager.

325
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,070
She liked a bit of family after her dad left.

326
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,830
Is that Tamara Drewe that writes a column

327
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,230
- in one of the Sundays?  - Used to.

328
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,460
- Writes for The Independent now.  - Oh.

329
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,910
She spent weeks going on about her nose job.

330
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,240
- Was her old one an awful conk?  - Yes.

331
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,080
She's poured herself into those shorts.

332
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,020
Hope they don't give her thrush.

333
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,280
Hello. Sorry to intrude.

334
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,980
- Hi, Tamara. Poppy.  - How are you?

335
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,960
I love your new hooter.

336
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,690
Thanks. It's not actually new, it's just smaller.

337
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,230
Tamara. So sorry about your mom.

338
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,460
- Thanks.  - Are you staying down for long?

339
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,630
I'll have to. There's so much to be done.

340
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,610
Well, let us know if we can help.

341
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,110
Could you spare a pair of strong arms?

342
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,540
I've got a skip coming tomorrow, and...

343
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,580
Nicholas?

344
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,380
- I'm available.  - I do skips.

345
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,050
Nicholas? Oh, bug...

346
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,020
Oh. Um...

347
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,130
Thank you, everyone. You're very kind.

348
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,130
Is Andy around at all?

349
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,990
Oh, I... I can't spare Andy.

350
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,500
He's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons. Heh.

351
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,740
We'll soon have that dry, don't worry. Heh-heh.

352
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,340
She's had Glen down there helping her all morning.

353
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,340
I hope she realizes he's here to work.

354
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,780
Can't believe what a difference her nose makes.

355
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,540
I think it's a mistake. Taken away all her character.

356
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,980
- Come on, she looks 10 times better.  - Huh.

357
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,990
And she knows it. I found those shorts really irritating.

358
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,890
Going around with half her bum hanging out. I mean, why?

359
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,720
- To annoy people like you.  - Hmm.

360
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,260
I might get a pair myself.

361
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,160
- Of course you wouldn't.  - Why not?

362
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,170
Because you're not desperate, are you?

363
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,070
There was always something desperate about Tamara Drewe.

364
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,830
Why did you change your face?

365
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,670
Changing my face is the best thing I ever did.

366
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,850
I don't care what anybody else thinks.

367
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,610
You think it would work for me? Maybe, if you did the wrinkles too.

368
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,550
Oh, you're just coming on to me now.

369
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,230
In your column, you write about yourself. Does that come easily?

370
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,730
Not easily. It just feels right.

371
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,200
My first novel is definitely going to be autobiographical.

372
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,740
Your first novel? You're gonna dash one off, just like that?

373
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,440
Heh. Ideally, I'd like to make it into fiction before I'm 30.

374
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,450
Then maybe a swimwear collection, chat show, pasta-sauce range.

375
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,640
What?

376
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,650
Life sure comes easy for the beautiful.

377
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,960
You know, before I had the nose job,

378
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,890
I had no problem being taken seriously.

379
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,390
Maybe when they removed that bit of cartilage,

380
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,090
they pulled out my brain by mistake.

381
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,330
What do you think?

382
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,360
Thank you.

383
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,500
She's single, you know.

384
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,240
Well, it's not exactly a relationship. We have an occasional thing.

385
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,150
- Zoe doesn't wanna be tied down...  - Not Zoe.

386
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,180
Tamara.

387
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,450
You should get in there. Marry the girl. Then you could live

388
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,320
- in your ancestral home again.  - No. Not her type.

389
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,330
Andy, you know, the trouble with you is that you think like a loser.

390
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,530
I know this because I'm the loser that all other losers come to for tips.

391
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,400
I am a loser's loser.

392
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,270
I'm a pedigree loser.

393
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,770
Had a graphics business, went bust.

394
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,470
Then with my great business acumen,

395
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,340
I invested in a poly tunnel full of ganja.

396
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,710
Spent six years stoned out of my box. I'm only just getting it back together.

397
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,720
Besides,

398
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,990
even if I was the last man in the world,

399
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,920
Tamara Drewe wouldn't have me.

400
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,420
Why not?

401
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,720
- I dumped her.  - Oh, you are a loser.

402
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,330
I was 20.

403
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,330
And my mates thought I was cradle-snatching.

404
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,640
- And they used to call her Beaky.  - Beaky?

405
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,200
Beaky?

406
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,230
Boys know nothing.

407
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,530
I've been reading Inchcombe's Dose. The bit where Dr. Inchcombe

408
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,440
finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy's daughter.

409
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,640
You describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile.

410
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,350
So who did you base her on?

411
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,020
Have you noticed me?

412
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,660
Because I've noticed you.

413
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,190
You're making yourself ridiculous.

414
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,040
Nichol-arse!

415
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,200
A man can dream, huh?

416
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,240
No.

417
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,420
Oh, write, you numbskull.

418
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,770
- The best ham I've had in ages.  - Good.

419
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,030
How's Thomas Hardy?

420
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,930
- I'm wasting my sabbatical.  - Oh, dear.

421
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,940
I've been writing this book forever. Don't know why I can't finish it.

422
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,740
Two years behind on my delivery date,

423
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,280
and Fantail could ask for their chickenshit advance back.

424
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,180
I can't write. I'm fucking constipated.

425
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,620
It's a disaster.

426
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,120
Crikey.

427
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,220
Oh. Uh, sorry, Glen. Um... I've gotta grab Andy before he rushes off.

428
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,300
Tamara's asked him to do up her house.

429
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,630
Why? She knows how hard he works for me.

430
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,800
Is this all his fan mail?

431
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,440
Yeah. I do a couple of sessions a week to keep on top of it.

432
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,140
Pretty good at forging Nick's signature.

433
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,050
Why don't we have a proper chat about it?

434
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,250
- Always used to help Nicholas...  - You'd do that? You have time?

435
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,730
I'll just, uh...

436
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,230
Tam?

437
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,600
Tam?

438
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,300
Tam?

439
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,640
Got some col or charts for you to see.

440
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,820
What col or do you think it should be in here?

441
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,260
Well, I was thinking, um,

442
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,830
this one for down here.

443
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,030
And, um...

444
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,970
- This one for the bedroom.  - Okay.

445
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,220
So, uh, what do you have to do to get a cup of tea around here?

446
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,250
Make it. Tea, sugar, fridge.

447
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,290
I'm off to work.

448
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,800
Hey!

449
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,460
- This is our village! Our fucking field!  - Go on.

450
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,610
- Get off!  - Come on, bastard. Let us in!

451
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,840
Kiss your mother with that mouth? Fuck off.

452
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,310
Get on, shove it.

453
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,670
Bullshit! Fuck off!

454
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,140
Swipe is fucking finished! Steve Culley is a...

455
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,510
Fuck off. Fran has been shagging that tosser.

456
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,350
- Steve, stop it!  - Come on then.

457
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,550
- Stop it!  - Uhn!

458
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,460
- I'm Tamara Drewe.  - What?

459
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,150
I'm supposed to be interviewing you, for The Independent.

460
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,320
It was scheduled for later,

461
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,360
but is now a good time?

462
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,870
Swipel Swipel Swipel

463
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,670
Swipel Swipel Swipel

464
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,340
- They should let us in for free.  - Too right.

465
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,750
They come here, drink our water, use our fields.

466
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,050
And they leave all their crap in our drains.

467
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,680
Nice girlfriend, mate.

468
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,550
Ben. Ben!

469
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,220
- What are you doing?  - That's Ben from Swipe.

470
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,520
And he's got his dog. Ben!

471
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,430
Ben! Ben!

472
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,790
That's Boss.

473
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,420
Up.

474
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,720
Boy. Come on.

475
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,560
- Hi, Boss.  - There.

476
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,630
- Not allergic, are you?  - To in die drummers?

477
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,290
Maybe.

478
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,260
Who the fuck's she?

479
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,900
I've seen her up at Stonefield. She's got a nose made of plastic.

480
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,320
So who are your influences?

481
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,470
Everyone asks that.

482
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,640
I mean, what do you want me to say? Phil Collins?

483
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,850
Animal from The Muppets?

484
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,490
- This your house?  - Yeah.

485
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,190
- Do you want to buy it?  - No.

486
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,990
I want something else.

487
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,600
How come she gets Ben? I've loved him since March.

488
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,110
- Would you like a beer?  - Yeah.

489
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,140
- Maureen Tucker.  - Who?

490
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,080
Moe Tucker. The Velvets. Five-foot-nothing.

491
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,480
Used to stand up to play.

492
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,250
Put the snare drum on its side and whacked it with mallets. Mentalist.

493
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,720
You write a lot of songs. That's pretty rare for a drummer.

494
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,590
Yeah, well, everything you've heard about drummers is complete shit.

495
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,360
You mean they don't spontaneously combust?

496
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,630
No.

497
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Only sometimes.

498
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,130
Any more questions?

499
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,910
Jesus. Oh, my God.

500
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,560
Hello.

501
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,630
Who are you?

502
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,980
You know anything about this dog, Tam?

503
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,330
You want some breakfast, Tam?

504
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,930
Tam?

505
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,630
- How goes the opus?  - Fine, Nicholas, just fine.

506
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,240
It's his most obscure novel, The Well-Beloved.

507
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,340
Most people have never even heard of it.

508
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,570
It's about a young guy of 20 who falls in love with a beautiful young woman.

509
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,410
Then when he's 40, he meets the woman's daughter and he falls in love with her.

510
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,640
And finally, when he's 60, he meets her granddaughter.

511
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,260
Oh, he doesn't.

512
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,820
Yeah. Falls in mystical love.

513
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,290
Hardy was the same in his life too.

514
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,800
Even as he aged, he only had eyes for young women.

515
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,960
It's like, in one essential way, he never grew up.

516
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,540
- In his trousers.  - Ha. Yeah.

517
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,440
He was still at it in his 80s, you know.

518
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,800
Snow on the rooftop, fire in the cellar.

519
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,640
Ha-ha. Why won't it come for you, Glen?

520
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,110
The way you talk about it is so engaging.

521
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,010
Do you wanna try?

522
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,290
Well, there's an academic style, you know?

523
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,020
Who are you writing for? Who's your ideal reader?

524
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,290
If wrote the way you spoke, you'd make me want to read Hardy.

525
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,020
- Really?  - Yeah.

526
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,020
If you wrote like you were talking to a friend. Try it again.

527
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,370
Oh.

528
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,270
Oh! Ha-ha-ha.

529
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,150
No, no, no. It's not as if I'm avant-garde.

530
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,090
- I simply pander to popular taste.  - Your books are far more than that.

531
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,390
Just airport fodder. I think I write them in my sleep sometimes.

532
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,290
I wish I wrote so well awake.

533
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,900
Your prose are so economical, so vivid, like the greats.

534
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,700
- Like Raymond Chandler.  - Oh, come on.

535
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,900
- Graham Greene.  - I'm just earning a crust.

536
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,170
You created Inchcombe.

537
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,740
If only he were real. He's my kind of man.

538
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,180
Yes. Sophisticated, jaded, but so vulnerable.

539
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,340
Cynical, but a man of total integrity.

540
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,750
My books don't say anything remotely profound.

541
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,990
I can't pretend to be an intellectual, not like the professor here,

542
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,260
illuminating our ignorance with his critical glow.

543
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,560
I love prose. I turn a decent plot. That's pretty much it.

544
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,800
- Excuse me.  - People like crime fiction,

545
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,940
because no matter how violent or shocking, it comforts them.

546
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,670
Secretly, Nicholas hates all this.

547
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,110
These crime weekends really take it out of him.

548
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,910
...in my case, a jaded doctor.

549
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,180
Let me help.

550
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,220
Oh, well, they need dusting with this.

551
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,790
Restoring order to...

552
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,820
I went to my room today,

553
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,350
and I wrote for three hours. The time, it just vanished.

554
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,630
That's great. That's brilliant.

555
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,500
I feel like a man who's just passed a gargantuan stool.

556
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,300
Oh, super.

557
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,100
Oh! Uh...

558
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,400
Sprig of mint on top.

559
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,270
Of course, my life isn't like that, so I just make stuff up. Ha-ha.

560
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,250
The real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie,

561
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,320
because that's what storytellers are, thieves and liars.

562
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,150
"The basis of all excellence is truth." Samuel Johnson.

563
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,170
! I met a girl on a farm Her name was Tamara!

564
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,570
Ben, I'm trying to write.

565
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,970
! I wanted to write her a song But one thing caused me alarm!

566
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,610
Please, Ben, it's a new story.

567
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,040
! Her name didn't rhyme With anything!

568
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,280
! Not a single thing I wanted to sing!

569
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,420
It comes from my heart, it's about my mom and dad.

570
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,990
! All she wants to do is type It's making me want a little bite!

571
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,390
! So cook me pasta carbonara Because I'm ravenous, Tamara!

572
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,730
! Then shag me Wearing your tiara!

573
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,720
Andy.

574
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,180
Let me dog in, will you?

575
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,320
Cheers, mate.

576
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,940
- He must like kissing plastic.  - He doesn't really love her.

577
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,140
He's just on the rebound from losing Fran.

578
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,680
Numbing his pain with loads of empty rampant sex.

579
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,980
What he really needs...

580
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,310
- Is a 15 year old from Ewedown?  - So? Stranger things happen.

581
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,690
He's only 10 years older, and that's nothing. If he met me...

582
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,230
- If he just met me...  - It'd be love, right?

583
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,190
Yeah. But I'd settle for sex.

584
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:16,160
Cooer, in your parents' bedroom? Still, I suppose being an exhibitionist

585
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,670
is part of his job, strutting about on stage.

586
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,040
He doesn't strut. He's a drummer.

587
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,140
He sits on his ass.

588
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,300
He's very good-looking, isn't he? Poppy You Tubed him.

589
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,280
We both got quite hot and bothered.

590
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,180
- Is that his car? The yellow Porsche.  - Yep.

591
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,050
Yeah, a bit brash, vrooming through the village.

592
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,130
Fancy our Tamara bagging a bona fide rock star.

593
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:43,460
She was such an ugly duckling. She must be thrilled to bits.

594
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,450
We're not open for another hour.

595
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,250
Good.

596
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,500
I mean, she used to be so funny. So human.

597
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,340
What does she see in that London knob?

598
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,710
He even wears fucking make up. How did she get so shallow?

599
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,220
Andy, are you really going on about her now?

600
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,940
- Oh.  - Where are your manners?

601
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,390
I'm sorry.

602
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,760
Bide your time, you big prick.

603
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,260
Oh, Ben.

604
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,310
Come here, you wretched beast!

605
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,950
Stinking animal!

606
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,950
Filthy hound!

607
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,090
Fuck soup.

608
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,530
Here.

609
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,670
- What's this?  - What does it look like?

610
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,470
Ben.

611
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,970
Which finger?

612
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,870
Wherever you want.

613
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,650
That one's nice.

614
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,750
Stick it on that one.

615
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,760
- Those girls could have aborted.  - Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out.

616
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,260
It beats me why you people want to live in the country.

617
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,330
- You have no sense of responsibility.  - It's not our dog.

618
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,170
Hello, Penny. How's tricks?

619
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,210
- Oh, Nicholas.  - You're looking good. Terrific coat.

620
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,280
- Oh, what, this old thing?  - You look like royalty.

621
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:06,140
- Well, I try.  - Can't wait for your next book.

622
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,150
Inchcombe's such a sauce pot.

623
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,250
Giles always says, "What are you reading, Penny?

624
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,150
You've got steam coming out of your ears."

625
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,290
What's the ring saying, Ben?

626
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,900
"Hello, I'm a ring. Will you marry me?"

627
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,710
What?

628
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,910
I didn't know.

629
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,240
Didn't know what?

630
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,980
That you're in love with me.

631
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,820
The ring is saying, "I'm platinum with a long guarantee.

632
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,020
Will you marry me?"

633
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,060
Yes.

634
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,940
- What?  - Oh, is Tamara there?

635
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,670
She is being proposed to.

636
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:19,020
Shh. There are writers here trying to write.

637
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,970
Hello.

638
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,700
Oh, um, this is, uh, a Buff Orpington. He's a bit peaky today.

639
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,970
They're not great layers, but they're very decorative. Heh.

640
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,940
We're, um... We're fully organic here.

641
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:43,450
Though, uh, I like to think our champion product is, uh, the written word. Heh-heh.

642
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,250
The famous Ben.

643
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,790
Swipe, eh?

644
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,260
No, Swipe's over. I thought the whole world knew that.

645
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:54,230
It wasn't on Newsnight, no.

646
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,590
Ben's engaged to Tamara. Isn't that lovely?

647
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,790
He'd just popped the question when I rang.

648
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,840
And she said yes?

649
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,900
We're delighted for you both.

650
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,310
Why is he on a fucking chain?

651
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,610
He was out of control.

652
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,770
How would you like to be chained up?

653
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,650
He was chasing livestock. He could have got shot.

654
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,050
They shoot him, I'll fucking shoot them.

655
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,900
Unbelievable.

656
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,100
Here, pooch. I think the word is gobshite.

657
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,130
I hope he makes her happy.

658
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,500
It's hard for girls when their dads walk out.

659
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,330
Gives them bad taste in men.

660
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,170
What's that supposed to mean?

661
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,470
Oh, just saying Tamara's father left when she was a girl and...

662
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,910
That is 1 0-pence psychology.

663
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,550
You don't know what you're talking about.

664
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,080
Poor little man.

665
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,010
"My Buff Orpingtons." "Oh, the written word."

666
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,010
What a fucking freak.

667
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,210
It's a shame the ring doesn't fit.

668
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,450
Why didn't you bring one of mine along when you bought it?

669
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,890
I didn't know you then, did I?

670
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,650
So when did you buy it?

671
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,390
Was it for someone else?

672
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,940
You bought it for Fran, didn't you?

673
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,230
So?

674
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,570
It's yours now.

675
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,540
She never wore it. She didn't want it.

676
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,340
- Did you ask her to marry you?  - Just as a gesture,

677
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,450
when she started seeing Steve. That backfired.

678
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,180
Look, it's you I wanna marry now.

679
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,760
The ring... The ring doesn't matter.

680
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,050
The ring's just a consumerist piece of zinc.

681
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,320
What matters is that I love you.

682
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,190
Do you?

683
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,060
Yes.

684
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:07,900
With my whole heart.

685
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,500
And all the other stuff.

686
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,540
Like me brain, me entrails.

687
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,080
Me pancreas.

688
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,910
It all wants to marry you.

689
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,020
Hmm?

690
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,130
She wondered if you had a delivery date in mind. I said Easterish.

691
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,590
Oh, mind that cocoa, it's hot.

692
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,860
There's a few invites. I'll pop them there.

693
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,090
You just tick the ones you want to go to.

694
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:42,040
Oh, and, uh, Tim wants to know if you'll do your Christmas signing in Hadditon.

695
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,510
I know he's always ungrateful, but I think it's so important

696
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,380
to keep these little bookshops open, don't you?

697
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,140
Mm-hm.

698
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,460
Come in soon, my love.

699
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,950
Look at that cellulite.

700
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,360
She been sitting on a bead car seat or what?

701
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,190
"Her latest tattoo count was nine,

702
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,730
including a Sumatran tiger and 'eternity' written in Sanskrit."

703
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,270
She'll be getting a bar code done next, right across there.

704
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,210
And Judy Garland's face right on there.

705
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,410
Nice baby, though.

706
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,410
I'd like one that col or.

707
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,250
Shut the fuck up.

708
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,480
- That Ryan's a dick.  - I think he's cute.

709
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,430
No, you don't. Would you snog him?

710
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:10,060
- Maybe.  - Be like having a slug in your mouth.

711
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,360
Shit.

712
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,100
Shut up, fat arse. It ain't funny.

713
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,710
- Ben.  - Ben?

714
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,780
Come on, let's do some messing.

715
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,590
- What about you, Glen? Sorry.  - Where will you be?

716
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,090
In London with a collection of spare academics.

717
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,590
We'll be decking the halls in our own erudite way.

718
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,850
I'll miss our chats.

719
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,430
Yeah. I've been in a state of writerly bliss these past weeks.

720
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,500
- I hope I get to come back.  - Oh. Me too. We'd love to have you.

721
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,500
You know, these are the best mince pies I've ever had.

722
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,170
If it were possible to have an orgasm from food,

723
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,610
these mince pies would do it.

724
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,580
Golly. Heh.

725
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,440
Fuck.

726
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,480
She keeps this here for Andy.

727
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,860
- What if she's got an alarm?  - Soon find out.

728
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:13,930
- What if they come back?  - If you're too chicken, go home.

729
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,900
- What the fuck are we doing here?  - It's kind of research.

730
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,570
I want to write about them. They're funny.

731
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,770
Come on, Ben.

732
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,110
2001 was the best year. I just sold my last three cases.

733
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,810
- It's a perfect wine for the price.  - Besides, I want to show you off.

734
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,290
What am I, arm candy?

735
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,980
More like arm fungus with that face.

736
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,260
I got her this gorgeous Rajasthani Ghagra skirt.

737
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,520
Divine.

738
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,790
She'll probably loathe it. Ha-ha.

739
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,060
- But if she does, I'll have it.  - Glen.

740
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,070
- Hi.  - Meet Ben. Ben, Glen.

741
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,770
- Hi, Ben.  - Ben's my fiance.

742
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,210
- You're getting married?  - Uh-huh.

743
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,070
Okay. Beautiful dress, magazine photo shoot.

744
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,310
Everything the aspiring novelist needs.

745
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,890
- I knew you'd be pleased.  - Have a mince pie? No.

746
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,260
Congratulations.

747
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,180
- Can we get the fuck out of here?  - Wait.

748
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,430
In Field of Tares, you made Fred a corporal,

749
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,690
but there's no such thing in the Royal Artillery.

750
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,100
They call them bombardiers.

751
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,070
- Oh, thank you for that.  - Very good.

752
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,500
Sorry.

753
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,610
- Hello.  - Tamara.

754
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,410
Would you make that out for Ben?

755
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,380
- To Ben.  - My fiancE.

756
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,760
We're getting married in the summer.

757
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,450
So I hear.

758
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:21,190
My heartiest commiserations, Tamara.

759
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,870
Merry Christmas, Nichol-arse.

760
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,310
Casey, look.

761
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,340
The sticks.

762
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,140
No, don't touch.

763
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,390
Pour Homme.

764
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,930
Smells like men.

765
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,770
- Live the dream, Case.  - Live the dream, Jode.

766
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,030
His boots.

767
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,510
! This is a call for a domestic dispute!

768
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,340
! She's got me in the corner And she's put in...!

769
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,270
Ben.

770
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,010
Oh, my God.

771
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,930
Look, stop going on about it.

772
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,550
I've invested a lot of time into this house.

773
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:23,000
- Why don't you sell it, then?  - Because I've started writing.

774
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,260
You can write anywhere.

775
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,300
Yes, we've done it.

776
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,010
No, Ben, this is proper. It's not just stuff for the paper.

777
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,480
It's about my teens, and it's actually working for me here.

778
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,640
I'm glad it's memory lane for you, but it's doing my fucking head in.

779
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,790
I want some London. Some noise, some urban.

780
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,960
I've had enough. Are you with me or what?

781
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,320
Of course, I'm with you.

782
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,520
It's depressing here. It's boring.

783
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,660
And every time I look out the window, I see Andy Cobb's arse.

784
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,670
What's that about?

785
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,110
Oi!

786
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,820
Tammy says you got Christmas geese.

787
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,520
Yep.

788
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,000
We're leaving, thank fuck.

789
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,570
Well, give us one then.

790
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,300
Right now?

791
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:20,270
Yeah.

792
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,210
That one's spare. Help yourself.

793
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,540
You having a laugh?

794
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,910
What? It's fucking alive.

795
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,850
I suppose you'd better kill it then.

796
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,950
How?

797
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,960
Gently put its head down there.

798
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,190
Quick in the back of skull with this. Pluck it while it's warm.

799
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:46,730
Little pot to catch all the blood.

800
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,870
You enjoy that?

801
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,040
No.

802
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,300
But in my low-wage economy, this flock's worth a lot.

803
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,710
You are one sick fuck, Andy.

804
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,380
- Grow up.  - What, mate?

805
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,790
I said, grow up.

806
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,820
Little drummer boy.

807
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,470
Tam phoned this morning.

808
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,410
Told me to finish the house.

809
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:35,990
Goes on the market in the spring, and that's it. Over.

810
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:40,850
Why does the ass hole always get the girl?

811
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,390
Come on, or you'll miss that train.

812
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,290
Andy.

813
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,890
So, what about this shed? Am I dismantling it or mending it?

814
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,580
Hang on.

815
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,970
I don't know. The shed.

816
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,460
What do you think?

817
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,470
I recommend preserving it.

818
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,080
Really?

819
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,210
Always useful, a good shed.

820
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,850
Well, then keep it.

821
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,700
Oh...

822
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:54,200
Classy job, Uncle Andy.

823
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:58,440
It's like, transformed.

824
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,510
Ben won't like this.

825
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,670
Bit boring.

826
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:05,910
Bit old folks.

827
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,950
I like those curtains. And I like that.

828
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,090
No, don't like those lamps, or that paper.

829
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,230
I'd have gold leaf embossed all round there,

830
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,420
and a wall of flamingo.

831
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,530
- Ben would like that.  - That's a lovely chair.

832
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,630
What's under here?

833
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,010
I'd have a bead curtain.

834
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:42,990
And the bathroom needs to be darker, like deep chocolate or velvet plum.

835
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,450
And I'd bathe in scented oils.

836
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,190
And then I'd be ready for Ben.

837
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,570
It won't just be a shag, Case. It'll be an event.

838
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:04,370
I'll be wearing, like, a gossamer shirt and a bra set, Prada.

839
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,610
And he'll be wearing a black T-shirt.

840
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,980
And it'll be all taut over his buff bod.

841
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:16,280
And underneath, Calvin Klein boxers, black.

842
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:21,560
And he'll have a tattoo of my name, and lush pecs.

843
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,830
And I'll smell of Allure by Chanel.

844
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,370
And he tries to resist me but I'm a vision.

845
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,840
"Ahh."

846
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:35,140
But also respectful.

847
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,710
And my V plates will melt into nothing.

848
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,510
Are you listening?

849
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,990
- I like this.  - What?

850
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,220
There's this bit where Tamara's dad takes her out for dinner,

851
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,490
and she thinks it's some big treat, but what he's doing, right,

852
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,330
is telling her that he's leaving them, and she... Right, she's gutted.

853
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,900
She yak s up her food into her napkin and puts it on his plate.

854
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,260
- So?  - It's painful.

855
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:07,380
But funny. It's about her, Plastic Fantastic.

856
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:12,820
- Jode, she's sad. Sad?  - She's a lucky cow.

857
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,090
I've been re-reading Inchcombe Etherised,

858
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,120
one of Nicholas's early books.

859
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:26,260
There's a character, Theo, who's an adulterer.

860
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:32,100
And Theo has a list of golden rules called Lulling the Spouse.

861
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:37,380
"To allay suspicion," he says, "you must first arouse it."

862
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:40,050
Nicholas rang me earlier to say he was going to be late home.

863
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,540
Yeah, I just bumped into Raoul and Celia.

864
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,240
I said, "Oh, that's nice."

865
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,480
And thought, "Have you?"

866
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,780
And I couldn't shake the suspicion.

867
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,720
So after an hour, I phoned Raoul.

868
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,890
Hello? Yeah, he's right here.

869
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,870
And he put Nicholas straight on the line.

870
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,970
Hello.

871
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:07,940
He's been telling the truth a lot recently.

872
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,040
Is he lulling me?

873
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,510
I might remind him that in Inchcombe Etherized,

874
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:23,420
Theo's wife runs him through with a carving knife.

875
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,840
- What are you doing?  - Just messing.

876
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,840
I got three valentines.

877
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:44,740
One from Mom, one from that peanut Ryan,

878
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,820
and a mystery one from Ben.

879
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,280
I sent you that.

880
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,050
Is that theirs?

881
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,350
It's my mom's. They don't drink this shit.

882
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,050
Come upstairs and look at what I'm doing.

883
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,860
I've got into her e-mails. We have to get Ben to come back.

884
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,370
I'm sending him a valentine.

885
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,340
- No, you're not.  - From her address.

886
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:10,030
Then he'll think it's from Tamara, you dipshit.

887
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:12,400
But I know it'll be from me.

888
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,950
Hot love.

889
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,540
Oh, God. Jody.

890
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,310
"Contacts." Where are you, Ben?

891
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,220
There's that bloke my mom works for, Nicholas Hardiment.

892
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,880
Let's put him on. Who else?

893
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,190
- Uncle Andy.  - Andy Cobb.

894
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,590
Come to Winnards Farm.

895
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:40,640
I'll give you the biggest shagging of your life.

896
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:43,140
Love, Tamara. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

897
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,120
- Don't ever, ever send that.  - I just did.

898
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,540
What the fuck is this?

899
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,150
"Come to Winnards Farm,

900
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,330
and I'll give you the biggest shagging of your life."

901
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,990
"I'll give you the biggest shagging of your life."

902
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,160
Are you listening to me?

903
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,170
Ben, will you stop drumming? I didn't write that e-mail.

904
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,710
Why don't you believe me?

905
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,370
When Fran started fucking Steve Culley,

906
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,810
at least she had the decency not to tell the whole world.

907
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,350
What's that supposed to mean?

908
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,790
She must want a foursome or something.

909
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,280
You fancy a foursome with Nicholas Hardiment?

910
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,860
Bugger that.

911
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,460
What was she thinking?

912
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,600
Well, maybe she's trying to make you jealous.

913
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,330
Or maybe she's trying to make the boyfriend jealous.

914
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,600
Or maybe she's just trying to give him a really big hint

915
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:42,400
that she's not getting enough.

916
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,810
Or maybe she's just a bit kinky. Or maybe she's crazy.

917
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,850
Or maybe she was off her face.

918
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:50,070
She was pissed.

919
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,620
I wasn't pissed or depraved or anything.

920
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:53,950
It's okay. It's okay.

921
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,050
Can you go look at the house? To make sure no one's been in.

922
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,950
- No problem.  - Thanks.

923
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,490
Ben's really pissed off.

924
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,820
- He's massively got the hump.  - Have I?

925
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,760
I've just asked Andy to have a look at Winnards.

926
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,260
I've got to go, I'm sorry.

927
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,160
- Are you a fucking idiot?  - What?

928
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,790
Are you thick? Isn't it obvious who wrote that e-mail? That tosser Andy Cobb.

929
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:16,200
- Andy wouldn't do that.  - Making himself cozy in your house,

930
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,900
going through your stuff. Probably got a pair of your pants on.

931
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,740
Bet it was him who nicked my black T-shirt.

932
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,610
- Of course, he didn't.  - Oh, that's it, jumping to his defense.

933
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,620
- He hasn't done anything.  - Boss. Boss.

934
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,520
What are you doing?

935
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,890
You know Fran's having a baby.

936
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,120
She wanted to see me. I wasn't going to, but now,

937
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,530
why not?

938
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:41,670
Come on, Boss, let's go for a crap.

939
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,260
Come on, mom, she's just stirring shit. Tamara's always done that.

940
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,930
- Yes, but why?  - You know how subversive she is.

941
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:53,910
She once sent me a valentine from Prince Harry and I believed it.

942
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,780
It's her sense of hum or. She likes causing trouble.

943
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:00,320
At school, she used to give us first-years tips on how to shoplift.

944
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:02,720
She taught you how to shoplift?

945
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:06,260
Mom, she's marrying Ben Sergeant.

946
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,490
Why would she look at an old git like Dad?

947
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,600
Hmm. I just don't get the joke.

948
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,030
And why is your father on the e-mail? And Andy?

949
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,100
- It's so tasteless.  - Help me out with these, would you?

950
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,370
I have to work on my thesis on the Taliban.

951
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,340
Taliban, I know.

952
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:28,620
What do you make of that e-mail from Tamara?

953
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,620
Don't make any sense.

954
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:34,490
That London boyfriend's trying to fuck her up. That's my theory.

955
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,850
She could do so much better.

956
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,130
I couldn't agree more.

957
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,510
- It's Ben.  - "Who's the Daddy?"

958
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,870
"Steve Culley and Fran Redmond

959
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,880
recently announced they were expecting.

960
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:57,850
But in a valentine-tryst shocker, Fran is snapped with ex Ben Sergeant.

961
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,820
Ben and Fran, we say, 'Get a room."'

962
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:03,350
- He's back with Fran?  - After you sent that e-mail, Jode.

963
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,580
No way. No way.

964
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,290
There's Plastic.

965
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,460
- Oh, my God, what have I done?  - What have you done?

966
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,300
What if Ben's dumped her?

967
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,270
What if he never comes back?

968
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,570
I'll never see Ben again and it's all my fault.

969
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,340
- What's all your fault?  - None of your business.

970
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,400
I'm bloody sick of you looking like a wet weekend.

971
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,800
- Who's Ben?  - No one.

972
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,410
- What have you done?  - Nothing.

973
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,550
- You in trouble?  - No, leave me alone.

974
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,180
You take care with boys, Jody.

975
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,750
You know what can happen.

976
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,650
What can happen?

977
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:12,230
What can ever, ever happen in a place like this?

978
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,870
Hello. I thought you were in London with Ben from Swipe.

979
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,500
- I'm looking for Andy.  - Well, he's not up at Stonefield.

980
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,810
So where's this shag you've been offering me?

981
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,510
- Fuck off.  - Come on. I saw that e-mail.

982
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,020
Well, I didn't send it.

983
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:38,710
And I wouldn't shag you if you were the last man left after a nuclear winter.

984
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:41,160
I'll come round tomorrow then, about 3?

985
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,020
Drop dead, you smug prick.

986
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,090
Watch out.

987
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:43,620
Yeah, I'll... I'll probably stay at the library another hour or two.

988
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,920
Yeah.

989
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,630
Yeah, just checking some law reports.

990
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,960
You're a marvel.

991
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,070
Okay.

992
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,350
Hello.

993
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,590
So,

994
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:21,970
Nicholas.

995
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,510
You can tell me to leave.

996
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,540
You can throw me right out.

997
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,390
Just say the word,

998
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,490
and I'll go.

999
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:21,060
Do you smoke after sex?

1000
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,860
I don't know, I've never looked.

1001
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,400
I used to watch you out of my window,

1002
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,270
helping your daughter skateboard up the lane.

1003
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,240
Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it?

1004
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:38,580
Is that why I'm here? To expurgate the crush?

1005
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,240
I don't know.

1006
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,320
Or as revenge on your ex?

1007
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,520
I don't know, Nicholas.

1008
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,920
Why are you here?

1009
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:49,780
I should have thought that was obvious.

1010
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,190
Since you climbed over that stile in the summer,

1011
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:59,870
I haven't thought about very much else.

1012
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,670
- When can we do this again?  - What about Beth?

1013
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:12,110
- Beth and I have this kind of open...  - Bullshit.

1014
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,550
- Thursday?  - Isn't life complicated enough?

1015
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,950
Don't put me in your column.

1016
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,850
In your dreams.

1017
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,800
Structure can be so sterile, can't it?

1018
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:34,100
I always think of it as a 3-dimensional...

1019
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,110
- Oh.  - Oh, here he is.

1020
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:40,670
Oh, poor you. Was it awful? I was starting to worry.

1021
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:45,050
Bloody terrible. Didn't move till well past Chiswick, but look.

1022
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:47,950
- I popped into Fortnum's.  - My favorite teas.

1023
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:54,990
Oh, my goodness, you feel like my buzzy toothbrush just after I've charged it up.

1024
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,620
- You should go to London more often.  - Well, maybe I will.

1025
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,390
Oh. Sorry, everybody. Traffic was a pig. Do carry on. What have I missed?

1026
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:05,800
Well, I'm trying this magic realist bit at the end of Chapter 3.

1027
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,340
- Oh. That sounds very innovative.  - Oh, you think so?

1028
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:11,780
Yes. I think I've always been waiting for the, uh, magic realist crime novel.

1029
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:16,140
Wuthering Heights, it's kind of Angel of the North.

1030
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:33,540
So after two years of radio silence, I contact my editor,

1031
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:37,770
and she loves... I mean, she loves the chapters I did in the fall.

1032
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,530
Oh, Glen. Ha-ha.

1033
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,810
I tried writing at the library

1034
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:46,380
but I could feel that awful paralysis descending again.

1035
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:50,680
I missed everything that I've been, you know, finding here.

1036
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,180
Oh, my God.

1037
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,160
It's so beautiful.

1038
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,020
Well, I'm very glad you've come back.

1039
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,060
Yeah, in a few solid weeks...

1040
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:02,360
Holy cow!

1041
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:06,270
- Idiots!  - Ha-ha.

1042
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,230
Morons!

1043
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,000
Ha-ha.

1044
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:16,010
Hey, writers, let's egg the self-regarding sacks of shit.

1045
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:19,240
It's half term, they're just bored.

1046
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,450
There's this theory that Hardy gave his wife syphilis, you know.

1047
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,390
No evidence, but the symptoms fit. Poor woman,

1048
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,330
she starts to get eccentric and then she moves her bed up to their attic.

1049
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,520
The bastard.

1050
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,730
Meanwhile, Hardy falls in love with a woman 39 years younger than him.

1051
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,700
- I don't believe it.  - Yeah, he was 65 and she was 26.

1052
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,400
- Geoff.  - Glen.

1053
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,100
- Henry James?  - Thomas Hardy.

1054
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,270
- That's it, a Hardy book.  - Coming well?

1055
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:50,010
- Yes, actually.  - He gave his wife syphilis.

1056
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,210
Jolly good.

1057
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:56,310
Oh, he... He's completely distracted.

1058
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:58,460
He's up and down to London all the time.

1059
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,750
This latest Inchcombe's taking everything he's got.

1060
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,560
It's really preying on him.

1061
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,500
Is it any good? Because I keep changing things

1062
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:09,690
- and...  - Shh.

1063
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:18,080
It's brutally candid.

1064
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,370
You lay yourself completely bare.

1065
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:30,450
It's a bit over-written. It needs a good edit, but, uh,

1066
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,550
it's very moving.

1067
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,390
Thank you.

1068
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:38,300
So,

1069
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:40,970
have I done my duty?

1070
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,000
Admirably.

1071
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:45,470
Now do I get my treat?

1072
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,840
You are so cheesy.

1073
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,020
Zero Ben sightings in two whole months.

1074
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:04,090
Last time I saw Plastic, she looked like a minger.

1075
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,090
All red-eyed and gutted.

1076
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,090
Ben's a love rat.

1077
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,130
You gotta face it, she should move on.

1078
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,830
She's probably topped herself.

1079
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,470
- I would, if Ben dumped me.  - Jode, don't say that.

1080
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,510
What if she's done something?

1081
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,410
Like got in the bath with her heated tongs?

1082
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,710
Like taken a stack of pills. Think she might be lying there,

1083
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,610
- all choked in vomit and drug froth?  - That'd be dire.

1084
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,650
If we find her, we'll get in the papers. Oh, my God.

1085
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,720
Rock chick dead at Winnards Farm.

1086
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,340
What's Uncle Andy doing here?

1087
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,890
Ass biscuits.

1088
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,400
No answer.

1089
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:20,940
She could've been there days. She could be all putrid-like, rancid.

1090
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,080
Oh, no, gonna chuck.

1091
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:27,050
- All bloated and all green y.  - Uncle Andy will find her by the smell.

1092
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,980
- Ugh.  - Shh.

1093
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,680
Andy.

1094
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,050
- Oh, bollocks, she's alive.  - Haven't seen you for a while.

1095
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,920
Thought you might be ill or something, or depressed.

1096
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,360
I've had my head down, writing.

1097
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:41,590
Come for a drink.

1098
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:44,360
- Let's lighten up.  - I'd love to, but,

1099
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:48,530
I'm kind of on one with my writing, and...

1100
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,400
Can we do it soon, though?

1101
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,100
I really would like to. Just not right now.

1102
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,410
Sure.

1103
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,820
What is he doing here?

1104
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,930
Oh, he just came by on the off-chance.

1105
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,960
Off-chance of what?

1106
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,570
Something about the roofing for the shed.

1107
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,240
- Do you think he's in with a chance?  - No way.

1108
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:28,400
- Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.  - Jody, he's my uncle.

1109
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:31,570
She'd be mad not to have him. Bet he goes like a train.

1110
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,980
Let's go, my knickers are wet.

1111
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,290
Wait, wait.

1112
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,940
Oh, my God.

1113
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,170
Nicholas, go.

1114
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:05,620
"Prolific author of intelligent crime novels."

1115
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:08,720
Fucking D-list. How could she do that after Ben?

1116
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:12,050
- He's not even a proper celeb.  - Maybe she's numbing the pain.

1117
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,250
Trying to tear love...

1118
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,090
Oh, shut up, Case. She's just a slag.

1119
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:18,060
She went out and pulled a married man.

1120
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,830
Like that bitch that went off with my dad.

1121
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:26,470
I know who I feel sorry for.

1122
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,440
Then there'll be the divorce and acrimony,

1123
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,350
- and Beth's world will fall apart.  - Yeah.

1124
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,650
But maybe one day, she'll put the bitterness behind her,

1125
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,090
and find a new love.

1126
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,990
Don't be daft. She's old, you sop.

1127
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,930
See?

1128
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,430
That's D-list's car.

1129
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,270
This is where he hides his car when he goes to shag Plastic.

1130
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,470
Yeah. Dirty git. Big old turd.

1131
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,240
- He's a rotten cheater.  - Like my dad.

1132
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,440
Come on, Case. Let's fuck him up.

1133
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,420
Shit salad.

1134
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,890
Oh, poor you. What a drag.

1135
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,530
Yes, it's a frightful bore.

1136
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,330
I'll hold off on the paella then.

1137
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,400
You're a marvel. See you soon.

1138
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,200
Did you...?

1139
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:33,350
Beth, can I use the printer?

1140
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:37,280
Nicholas is stuck on the motorway with a flat tire,

1141
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,980
but I couldn't hear traffic, just rooks.

1142
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,490
Hmm.

1143
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,310
Sorry, um, did you want me to read something?

1144
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,480
No. Can I use the printer?

1145
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,430
Nicholas, someone knows.

1146
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:57,600
- Maybe we should...  - Who cares?

1147
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:11,350
Casey, pop them. Pop them.

1148
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:19,060
Fucking bingo.

1149
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,060
Hello, Casey, how are you? Hello.

1150
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,300
- All right.  - Waiting for the bus?

1151
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,340
- Bus got scrapped.  - Oh, so it did.

1152
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,770
Well, hope it doesn't rain.

1153
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:38,410
- Gutted for her.  - Me too.

1154
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,570
Fat arse though, hasn't she?

1155
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,690
- Send her the photo, Case.  - I can't.

1156
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,920
- Why not?  - What if it ruins her life?

1157
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:51,150
We gotta do something. Plastic's an idiot.

1158
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:54,160
- She fucked it up with Ben.  - We fucked it up with Ben, Jode.

1159
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,140
It's like...

1160
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:04,540
We've gotta rescue her from D-list.

1161
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:35,600
- Casey.  - What?

1162
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:39,910
She's back in touch with him. She's got an e-mail from Ben.

1163
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:43,410
"Tamara, Fran's baby has come."

1164
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:46,950
Case, he says it's a little brown girl with curly black hair.

1165
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,520
Oh, cute.

1166
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:52,750
"I think we can safely say it's Steven Culley's, not mine.

1167
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,420
Truth is, I feel free.

1168
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,830
Gig in Paris for a few days.

1169
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,130
If I bring him down, would you have Boss?"

1170
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,930
Yes. Yes, he's coming back.

1171
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:07,570
- What are you doing?  - Dear, Ben,

1172
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:11,440
I have found a reliable dog lover in the village.

1173
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:13,510
- Who?  - Please call Jody,

1174
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,550
- You can't send that.  - on 07 700-900-929.

1175
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,620
- I'm getting him back down here!  - For who? You?

1176
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:22,950
- Why not me?  - Are you mental?

1177
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,750
- "Reliable dog lover"?  - You're making a great big mess...

1178
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:28,300
I'm making something happen!

1179
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:30,500
Otherwise, my whole life will go by,

1180
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:33,030
and I'll be 34 and washed up like my mom.

1181
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,300
And no one decent will ever even have snogged me.

1182
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:39,340
If you do this, you're on your own.

1183
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:41,640
Fuck off, then.

1184
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,440
You twat.

1185
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:50,910
There's the festival brochure. You're on in the Lanson marquee.

1186
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,820
And, um, I've marked a few bits, in case you want to read.

1187
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,960
You're a marvel. Cheers.

1188
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:58,790
I could come with you.

1189
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,160
Oh, don't. You hate festivals.

1190
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:04,300
But it's only Hadditon. I'll come.

1191
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:07,370
It'll be completely boring. You'll hate it.

1192
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,410
Stay here.

1193
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:23,620
Wow.

1194
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:35,030
Wanker! Aah! Right.

1195
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:38,600
- Ha-ha-ha.  - Finished.

1196
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:41,610
I'm doing this cake in celebration. Well done.

1197
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,110
Well, to Hardy.

1198
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,110
Yeah, even though I can't bear the man for what he did to his wife.

1199
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,710
Oh, thanks, Andy. Just pop them over there.

1200
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,990
How do I find out who sent this?

1201
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,870
It says "number withheld."

1202
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:12,340
Did you know?

1203
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,740
I couldn't tell you.

1204
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,950
I'm sorry, Beth.

1205
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:28,020
Her.

1206
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,360
Oh, my God.

1207
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:33,550
Oh, this is just... This is just horrible.

1208
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:34,760
Right under my nose.

1209
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:36,800
- Oh, it's so shitty.  - God, I feel sick.

1210
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:39,770
So insulting. You do not deserve to be treated like this.

1211
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,600
If you're kind to me, I'll cry.

1212
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,670
And I don't want to cry, I must be very clear.

1213
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:47,550
If there's anything that I can do...

1214
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:50,040
I have to do it by myself.

1215
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:56,780
Oh, come on. Come on, Beth. Come on.

1216
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,890
I trod in the sponge mix.

1217
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,070
Jody? This is Ben Sergeant.

1218
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,940
Yeah, that's right. I love dogs.

1219
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:16,270
Yeah, so I'll see you at Winnards Farm at 2:00.

1220
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,910
Yeah. Perfect.

1221
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,320
Andy.

1222
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,250
Hey, how are you?

1223
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:37,000
I wondered if you wanted to go for that drink?

1224
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:40,330
- I need a friend at the mo...  - You and Nicholas Hardiment.

1225
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,730
That's a nice piece of work, isn't it?

1226
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:46,840
I get it from his point of view. He's always been a cheating wanker.

1227
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,770
Loves having his cake and eating it.

1228
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,820
But since when did your standards drop so low?

1229
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,280
You could have anyone.

1230
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,220
- All you have to do is bat your eyes.  - Andy.

1231
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:02,290
I care a lot about Beth. She helped me out when I was at rock bottom.

1232
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,980
I'm not going to split them up.

1233
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,960
- It's just...  - A bit of fun?

1234
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:09,030
It's none of your bloody business.

1235
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,730
- Andy Cobb knows.  - Cock pie. Has he told Beth?

1236
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,530
I don't know, but he might. And I wouldn't blame him.

1237
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:18,170
I suppose it has to come out sometime.

1238
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,370
Does it?

1239
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:22,510
It's a good thing. Feels like a relief. It means we can think about

1240
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,770
- our plans for the future.  - What future?

1241
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:27,480
I know it's been hard for you, sharing me with Beth.

1242
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:29,780
But I'm yours now. I'm gonna leave her.

1243
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,920
Mr. Hardiment. It's time.

1244
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:38,090
I want a new life with you.

1245
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:42,500
It's a nice dog, Mom.

1246
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:46,000
Well, I don't like having dog hair and slobber all over the place.

1247
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,500
But I said yes.

1248
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,270
No dogs, no way, and that's final.

1249
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:54,540
You loser, I hate you! You want to ruin my life!

1250
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,910
Live the dream, Jody.

1251
01:26:58,090 --> 01:26:59,680
Well, it all runs very smoothly.

1252
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:03,120
I start a book in the summer and publish it the following spring.

1253
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:05,280
Bit of a factory, really.

1254
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:10,790
So you've finished Like The Night, which is the 1 7th of the Inchcombe adventures.

1255
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,130
And we all assume you're planning the next one already.

1256
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,030
Well,

1257
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,330
there isn't gonna be a next one.

1258
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:20,600
- No.  - What?

1259
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,940
Frankly, I'm sick to death of Inchcombe.

1260
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,740
In fact, I'm about to kill him off.

1261
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:27,350
- No.  - He can't do that.

1262
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,750
Well, I think that's what we call in the trade,

1263
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,890
a bit of a bombshell, for your fans here.

1264
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:37,520
Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh pastures.

1265
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,460
No.

1266
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:41,890
Inchcombe is about to meet a very sticky end,

1267
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:45,160
and it's one murder I'm really looking forward to.

1268
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:49,940
Now, at this point, we should get some questions, I think.

1269
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:53,910
And I'm... Yes, there's a lady over there.

1270
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:02,240
You write a lot about adultery, is that from personal experience?

1271
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:04,910
Madam,

1272
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,920
what a saucy question. Uh...

1273
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:11,650
But there's no need for an author's work to be autobiographical...

1274
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,690
Why do you cheat persistently on your wife?

1275
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:17,230
Who's that?

1276
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,800
Because she lets me.

1277
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:27,940
Tamara.

1278
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:31,250
- Where...?  - Nicholas, this has got to stop.

1279
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,610
You're right. I can't go on using her. Lying to her.

1280
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,220
It won't be fun but I've gotta do it.

1281
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:38,120
I don't feel alive with Beth. I haven't been living for years.

1282
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:41,320
- She's smothered me like a blanket.  - Nicholas, listen to me.

1283
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:45,260
It was fun, but it's wrong and it's over.

1284
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:51,000
- I'm in love with you.  - I'm sorry.

1285
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:52,570
No.

1286
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:56,180
No. No. No. You can't end it. Tamara...

1287
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:58,400
- Fuck supper!  - Will you keep it down?

1288
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,980
- My God, you're cold-hearted.  - No, I'm not.

1289
01:29:01,150 --> 01:29:03,950
- You don't feel a thing, do you?  - I do. I do feel.

1290
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:07,320
I feel like I'm blazing away inside all the time.

1291
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,250
Why do I do these things? What am I doing with you?

1292
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,690
- There's someone else, isn't there?  - Oh, for God's sake.

1293
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:18,590
- Not the narcissist drummer?  - Goodbye.

1294
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,460
It's that ignorant lunk, isn't it?

1295
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,500
That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.

1296
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:27,240
Andy Cobb is a far better man than you.

1297
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:32,470
Go on.

1298
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:40,550
Mr. Hardiment, will you sign this? Imagine getting him to sign.

1299
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,210
I love your books.

1300
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,810
Thank you.

1301
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:11,450
Hello?

1302
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:16,960
It's Jody Long about the dog.

1303
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:22,730
Ben?

1304
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:29,800
Hello?

1305
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:34,340
Ben?

1306
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,450
Ben?

1307
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,700
Well, you gonna answer that?

1308
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,410
Jody, what are you doing not fucking answering?

1309
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:10,210
Ben's dog is here. It's loose. It means Ben must be up at Winnards.

1310
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:13,550
Boss!

1311
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,550
Dog minder?

1312
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,030
You've been breaking in, sending e-mails and fucking people off.

1313
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,730
- Did you nick my black T-shirt?  - I just wanted to meet you. Just once.

1314
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,960
- Just to tell you stuff.  - Stuff? What stuff?

1315
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:32,230
Like, I love you.

1316
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,370
I really, really love you.

1317
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,540
That's really nice.

1318
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:43,120
I used to lie awake thinking about you being here.

1319
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,950
In Ewedown.

1320
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,420
In the bum-hole of nowhere.

1321
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:52,160
When you left, I couldn't bear it.

1322
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:55,860
I just wanted to make you come back.

1323
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:05,210
Do you still love me, Jody? Even though I wanna lock you up?

1324
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:08,640
What would you do for me then?

1325
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,540
Would you do anything, like a proper fan?

1326
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,140
Let's see then, shall we?

1327
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:19,690
I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well, she'll find out. Nicholas doesn't do children.

1328
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,790
He'll leave it all up to her. Oh.

1329
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,550
- That'll age her.  - Beth.

1330
01:32:23,730 --> 01:32:26,290
Suppose he discovers fatherhood? They do, these men.

1331
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:30,330
Second time around, they get all nappy-happy.

1332
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,300
I was barely 20 when I got pregnant.

1333
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:35,770
- I've never done anything. God.  - Yes, you have. Look at this place.

1334
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:38,170
I've let him walk all over me. Why? Why have I done that?

1335
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:39,710
I... I've wasted my life.

1336
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,680
No. What about the work you've done here?

1337
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:42,870
- Work?  - Yes.

1338
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:46,040
What, breeding goats? Baking fucking biscuits?

1339
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:47,550
It's meaningless!

1340
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,420
Beth.

1341
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:53,720
When I was lost with my book, you helped me more than you know.

1342
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,160
You asked me who I was writing it for.

1343
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,630
You.

1344
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:23,290
Excuse me.

1345
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,620
May I speak with my wife?

1346
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,100
No, you may not.

1347
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:35,100
Beth. Beth.

1348
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,640
It's over.

1349
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,270
I've finished it.

1350
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,680
She's been chasing me.

1351
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:46,150
I think there's something unhinged about her.

1352
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,780
This wild crush.

1353
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:53,280
Ben Sergeant's bloody dog again. Go on, get out.

1354
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:57,760
Back to that tart at Winnards Farm. Go on. Bugger off!

1355
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:00,220
Beth.

1356
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,230
You know I'm sorry.

1357
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,030
I want you to leave. I want a divorce.

1358
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:09,200
No, you don't. Don't be ridiculous.

1359
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,470
Now, look... And I want this place.

1360
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,400
You can't.

1361
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,340
Watch me. I will.

1362
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:22,780
That's it, lovely. Keep it going, keep it going. Stop. Couple of sugars.

1363
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:26,290
Stir it.

1364
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:38,900
That is a very good cup of tea. Which is lucky for you, Jody.

1365
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:40,130
Had it been shit,

1366
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:42,870
I'd be on the phone to the extremely scary local cops right now.

1367
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,440
Please don't tell my mom.

1368
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:47,170
I know it's boring round here, but for fuck's sakes.

1369
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:48,940
I'm gonna get out soon as I can.

1370
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:52,610
I'm gonna work in Vegas as a croupier. Vegas or a cruise liner.

1371
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:57,920
Aim high, Jody. That's what I say. Aim high.

1372
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,600
Ben?

1373
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:12,430
- You've had an infestation.  - Of what?

1374
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,370
Jody.

1375
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:38,000
Hey, Greg!

1376
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:41,160
- I want a word with you.  - It's Glen, ass hole.

1377
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,970
You fucking devious bastard.

1378
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:46,440
I'm devious? I'm a bastard?

1379
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:50,570
You think I haven't noticed you've been worming your way in?

1380
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:55,410
You keep your hands off my wife, you low-rent pedant.

1381
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:59,390
You've abused Beth long enough with all of your god damn lies.

1382
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,030
I want you out of my house.

1383
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:04,250
- It's Beth's. She made this place.  - And I fucking paid for it.

1384
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:06,760
I've given Beth all this. What can you give her?

1385
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:10,960
- I can give her integrity.  - Obscure literary shit,

1386
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,570
not worth 10 pence.

1387
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:16,540
You know, if I made my fortune fantasizing about rapes and murders,

1388
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,040
I wouldn't be so proud.

1389
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:21,540
- You cretin.  - Fuck you.

1390
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,640
Beth will come to her senses.

1391
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:28,120
- You need an income to run Stonefield.  - and mine's bigger than yours.

1392
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:39,930
Get up, Nicholas, come on. Let's talk about this like grown men.

1393
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:48,970
Oh, my God. Nicholas.

1394
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,570
Nic...

1395
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:53,180
- Uh...  - Get up.

1396
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:03,750
Nicholas, get up.

1397
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:06,720
Run. Come on. Get up.

1398
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,700
Nicholas. Nicholas.

1399
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:53,370
It was you?

1400
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:56,670
It was you who sent the e-mail?

1401
01:37:56,850 --> 01:38:00,110
Jody's explained that she did it out of a deep love for me.

1402
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,620
- Tammy.  - Ben.

1403
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:21,170
I think you should have this back.

1404
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,780
I'm sorry.

1405
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:27,810
Jody! The dog!

1406
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:16,160
Got him. The beast. Hm.

1407
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,220
Nicholas.

1408
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,170
God. Oh, God. Nicholas.

1409
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:54,100
Bitch. Brazen.

1410
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:56,200
- Brazen.  - Beth.

1411
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:59,970
- That is brazen.  - Beth, don't look! Please, don't look!

1412
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:06,050
Nicholas?!

1413
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:13,450
No!

1414
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:17,620
No, but you can see it. It's broken. It's smashed.

1415
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:22,730
No, I haven't, but it's obvious.

1416
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:28,230
Yes, his wife. Yes, she is.

1417
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:31,170
Thank you. Thank you, I will.

1418
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,810
They're on their way.

1419
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:38,450
Beth, help is coming.

1420
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:40,020
Aah!

1421
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:48,560
It's broken.

1422
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:20,390
Tamara.

1423
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:23,690
Listen.

1424
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,330
I'm sorry.

1425
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,710
Come on.

1426
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,280
Are you blaming yourself?

1427
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:37,710
It was an accident.

1428
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:55,370
I'd better get back up to Stonefield.

1429
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,500
Come with me. We'll get this sorted.

1430
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:07,340
Then get Ben to take you back to London.

1431
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:10,540
I don't want to be with Ben.

1432
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,630
Put it on the back seat right here.

1433
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,470
What are you doing?

1434
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:45,050
I figured it was best, you know, that I take off.

1435
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,450
She doesn't want writers around the place now.

1436
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,720
And police, autopsies, not my thing.

1437
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:52,290
- You can't run away.  - I'm not running away.

1438
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:56,590
I've finished my book. My time here is up. Destiny calls.

1439
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:00,360
- Beth is asking for you.  - Really?

1440
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,940
She's on her own over there.

1441
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:08,200
Glen, she doesn't need a writer around the place,

1442
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:10,800
she needs a man.

1443
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:22,020
I'm so sorry.

1444
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:26,120
It was my fault. I let the dog go.

1445
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,390
- No. No.  - I shooed him away.

1446
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:31,800
The police said it was an accident, but if I'd caught him, tied him up...

1447
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:33,200
No, it wasn't your fault.

1448
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:36,570
What I don't understand is why was Nicholas in that field anyway?

1449
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:39,210
He hated cows. And when he saw them coming,

1450
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:44,110
- why didn't he get out of their way...?  - Beth, I have to tell you that...

1451
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:58,790
You live in the country.

1452
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:01,060
You share it with those dangerous beasts,

1453
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:03,960
and when they get scared, they run.

1454
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:06,130
Like we do.

1455
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:09,170
Oh, Glen.

1456
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:14,610
Stay with me.

1457
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:51,480
- Kind of suits you.  - Don't say anything.

1458
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:53,990
I always did like the old one.

1459
01:44:57,230 --> 01:45:00,160
- You did it on purpose, didn't you?  - What?

1460
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:03,360
Made this place so beautiful I'd never be able to leave.

1461
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:05,830
Been dying to get rid of you.

1462
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,040
This is my house.

1463
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:13,540
- I was born in that room.  - So you were.

1464
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,670
Welcome home.

1465
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:58,920
Pap-pap me.

1466
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:00,920
What?

1467
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,560
Pap-pap me.
