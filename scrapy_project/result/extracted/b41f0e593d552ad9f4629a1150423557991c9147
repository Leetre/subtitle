圣弗朗西斯高中的篮球新秀
St. Francis High School basketball phenom

00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,810
泰·克瑞恩去年才被招入队中
Ty Crane, who they recruited just last year,

8
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,170
如今已被公认为是下一个勒布朗·詹姆斯
is widely held as the next LeBron James.

9
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,640
[The Crane：大吊车]
而我们就简称他为“克瑞恩”
We simply know him as "The Crane."

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,280
上啊
Come on.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,600
[今晚 篮球季前赛]
[里士满 对 圣弗朗西斯]

12
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,890
你们都加把劲啊！提摩，咱们上
Come on, y'all! Timo, let's go man, come on.

13
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,330
好，随你怎样
Yeah, whatever.

14
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,840
你在什么地方？你在什么地方？
Where you at? Where you at?

15
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,510
截住他，截住他！
Pick him up! Pick him up!

16
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,120
- 嘿，儿子  - 嘿
- Hey, son.  - Hey.

17
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,560
这里，这里
Right here, right here.

18
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,320
- 蓝方的球！ - 防得好，宝贝儿！
- Blue ball!  - Good D, baby!

19
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,190
- 妈的！ - 你们到底是干什么吃的？
- Damn!  - What the hell are you doing, y'all?

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,390
[举拳：传给我的意思]
- 你这样走了三步  - 我可把拳头举起来了
- You took three steps this way.  - Yo, l put my fist up, man.

21
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,940
瞧你把球扔哪儿了，妈的
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing the ball, man. Damn.

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,440
- 防住你的人呀！ - 我就知道，我就知道
- Get your man!  - l knew it. l knew it.

23
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,680
耶！
Yeah!

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,710
圣弗朗西斯领先二十二分
St. Francis is up by 22.

25
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,450
别想拦我，小婊子，吃定你了
Stay out of my way, bitch. l own you.

26
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,600
- 喂，住手！ - 小婊子！
- Oh, hell no!  - Bitch!

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,700
快去！快去！
Let's go! Let's go!

28
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,290
别这样，哥们，住手！
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

29
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,670
- 放开我！ - 嘿！嘿！
- Let me go!  - Hey! Hey!

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,070
我没事，放开我！
l'm good. Get off me!

31
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,940
放开我，放开我！
Get off me, get off me!

32
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,410
行了！比赛结束！
That's it! Game's over!

33
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,850
比赛结束！
Game's over!

34
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,420
克瑞恩，打得真棒，打得真棒
Crane. Great game, great game.

35
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,680
跟大伙儿说说吧，成为下一个勒布朗·詹姆斯是什么感觉？
Tell everyone out there what it feels like to be the next LeBron James.

36
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,450
勒布朗·詹姆斯？我是独一无二的泰·克瑞恩
LeBron James? l'm the only Ty Crane.

37
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,960
好，你们第一次听到了“独一无二的泰·克瑞恩”
All right, you heard it here first, "the only Ty Crane."

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,660
为什么坐冷板凳的家伙老是喜欢唧唧歪歪的？
Why do all the benchwarmers always got something to say?

39
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,300
我看你们打得那么烂，这就是为什么
We watching the damn game, that's why.

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,990
- 你们算是旁观者清了？ - 对
- You got a good view, huh?  - Yeah.

41
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,170
泰·克瑞恩一个人的得分就超过我们全队
Ty Crane outscored our whole team by himself.

42
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,740
- 真不知道是怎么搞的  - 我们总共才得了三十二分
- Wonder how that happened.  - We had nothing but 32 points.

43
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,840
这里面我得了十二分，你得了多少，凯尼恩？
l got 1 2 of them. What did you get, Kenyon?

44
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,840
闭嘴吧，小子，克瑞恩直冲你飞过去
Just shut up, dog. The Crane swooped down on you

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,180
来了个大灌篮，他可让你出洋相了，小子
and delivered a basket of beat-down. He clowned you, dog.

46
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,110
- 对，你最好给我闭嘴  - 整场比赛他都把你看死了
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.  - He had you on lock the whole game.

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,750
莱尔，你怎么还不闭嘴，是不是要我来帮你啊？
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth before l close it for good.

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
你整场比赛也是屁事都没干
You didn't do shit either the whole game.

49
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,660
说什么？我抽你丫的！
What, homey? l will slap the taste out your mouth!

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,880
- 咱们就不能不吵吗？ - 闭上你的臭嘴！
- Can we all just get along?  - Shut your little ass up!

51
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,150
- 你都没上场！ - 我要说的就是这个
- You didn't even play!  - That's what l'm talking about.

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,090
- 谢伊，传球啊，小子！ - 你在十六分钟里才得了两分
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!  - You got two points in 1 6 minutes,

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,460
- 所以教练才会让你滚蛋  - 没错！
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.  - Exactly!

54
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,100
提摩，你一直都在场上，可你根本没得过分
Timo, you was in the whole time, you never even touched the rock.

55
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,930
你屁事儿都没干，你也…
You didn't do shit. You might as well...

56
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,470
- 你把球传给谁去了？ - 你在场上屁事也没干！
- Who was you passing the ball to?  - You were playing and didn't do shit!

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,450
肯尼·雷·卡特，一九七二年里士满高中全美明星
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond High School all-American, 1 9 72.

58
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,420
见到你很高兴，先生
Good to see you, sir.

59
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,780
今晚看到你在看台上，我真的很高兴
l was really happy to see you in the stands tonight.

60
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,290
话说在前头，先生，我还没拿定主意呢
l have to tell you, sir, l haven't made up my mind yet.

61
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,490
我已经告诉过你，现在到了我引退的时候了
As l've told you, it's time for me to step down.

62
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,960
过去几年真是很难熬
Last few years have been really tough.

63
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,140
输球的日子确实难熬，先生
Well, losing's hard, sir.

64
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,270
不是输球的问题，肯尼
This isn't about losing games, Kenny.

65
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,770
我没法让他们来学校练习
l can't get them to show up for school, for practice.

66
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,440
家长也不闻不问，但是我也实在不想成天到街上找这些孩子
l can't get parents involved, and l'm done chasing kids in the streets

67
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,140
把他们拖进体育馆了
and pulling them into the gym.

68
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,940
是啊，这是件难办的工作
Yeah, it's a tough job.

69
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,320
里士满是个难办的小城
Richmond is a tough little city.

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,950
今晚在这里看见你的时候，我就想“我逮到他了，他答应了”
When l saw you here tonight, l thought, "l got him. He's in."

71
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,060
哦，说实话，我来这里另有原因
Well, actually, l was here for another reason.

72
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,890
我儿子在圣弗朗西斯队打球
My son plays for St. Francis.

73
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,590
真的？
He does?

74
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,800
- 是哪个孩子？ - 哦，你没看见他
- Which kid was he?  - Well, you didn't see him.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,270
- 他是新人，没有上场  - 那很好，那学校非常棒
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.  - That's great. Great school.

76
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,970
怎么，你想来吗？
What, you wanna go?

77
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,510
- 喂！ - 莱尔，行了！
- Hey!  - Lyle, bring it!

78
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,950
让他走，你以为人人都怕你？我才不怕你呢！
Let him go. You think everybody's scared of you? l ain't scared of you!

79
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,490
克鲁兹，冷静点，为什么你老是这么冲动？
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be trying to act all hard all the time, man?

80
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,120
啊，真受不了你！
God, l'm sick of you, man!

81
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,860
你知道，那学校在我上学的时候就挺粗野的
You know, that school was rough when l went there.

82
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,560
如今更过分了
lt's way beyond that now.

83
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,460
那就忘了它吧，提都不要提
Well, then, just forget about it. Don't even discuss it again.

84
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,800
这我还做不到，教练今晚正式请我去干这份工作了
l can't quite do that. Coach officially offered me the job tonight.

85
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,200
时间不等人
The clock's ticking.

86
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,280
你说“请你去工作”，那么通常就要谈到钱的问题了
And when you say "offering job," there's usually money involved.

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,850
是啊，可能给我开一千块
Yeah, there might be a thousand bucks in it for me.

88
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,450
干五个月？
For five months of work?

89
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,590
[意为讽刺]
哦，那你可没法拒绝
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

90
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,080
但是那支队实在太糟了
And the team, it's so bad.

91
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,090
那些孩子脾气太暴，太任性
Those boys, they're so angry and undisciplined.

92
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,230
再说你也知道，你没空
And besides, you know, you don't have the time.

93
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,920
你正打算再开一家店
You're trying to open up a second store.

94
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,530
对，我没有…天啊，我根本没有空
Exactly, l don't have the... Hell, l don't have any time.

95
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,760
你还答应了带你的女朋友去墨西哥
And you promised to take your girlfriend to Mexico.

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,430
我当然会说到做到
And l'm definitely keeping that promise.

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,870
我绝对不会不去墨西哥
There's no way l'm not going to Mexico

98
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,130
和穿着三点式泳装的你一起逛海滩
and hanging out on the beach with you in your bikini.

99
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,540
我不能接这份工作
l can't take that job.

100
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,480
那么，你什么时候开始？
So when do you start?

101
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,920
- 你应该先跟我说一声的  - 为什么？
- You should've spoken to me first.  - Why?

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,490
- 这是我个人的选择  - 那么这对我会有什么影响？
- lt was a personal choice for me.  - So, what happens to me?

103
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,210
你还会来看我比赛吗？
You still gonna come to my games?

104
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,260
我可能要错过你的大多数比赛了，戴米恩，对不起
l'll probably miss most of your games, Damien. l'm sorry.

105
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,980
那么我就去里士满为你打球
Then l'll go to Richmond and play for you.

106
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,390
不行
No.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,220
为什么不行？
Well, why not?

108
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,100
- 爸爸，你一直都是我的教练  - 这个学校非常棒，戴米恩
- Dad, you've always been my coach.  - This is a great school, Damien.

109
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,130
对你上大学很有利
lt puts you in a great position for college.

110
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,770
爸爸，我还是新人！
Dad, l'm a freshman!

111
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,570
不能因为我去里士满当教练
Just because l'm coaching at Richmond,

112
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,240
就改变我们对你未来的计划，明白？
it doesn't change our plans for your future, all right?

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,300
哥们，我要一小瓶，你有那种猛药吧？多少钱？
Yo, my man, l need a vial, man. You got that good dope? How much?

114
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,220
你忘了带学生证了，是吗？
You forgot to bring your lD, didn't you?

115
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,450
- 我忘了  - 每天都是
- l forgot it.  - Every day.

116
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,490
早上好，肯·卡特
Good morning. Ken Carter.

117
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,500
- 谢谢  - 给，先生
- Thanks.  - Here you go, sir.

118
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,260
嘿，怎么样？
Hey, yo, what's up?

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,870
- 再次见到我您很高兴，卡特先生  - 我也一样，夫人
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.  - You too, ma'am.

120
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,310
如果邀请仍然有效的话，我愿意执教这支队
lf the offer still stands, l'd like to coach the team.

121
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,280
我希望你乐意接下这份任务，这些年轻人需要管教
Well, l hope you're up for the task. These young men need discipline.

122
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,020
这份工作的薪水是一千五百美元
The job comes with a $1 ,500 stipend

123
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,320
条件是必须干满四个月
and a major time commitment for the next four months.

124
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,520
- 我接受  - 好极了
- l accept.  - Great.

125
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,300
你来这里我们非常高兴，先生们，我不想失礼
We're thrilled to have you. Gentlemen, l hate to be abrupt,

126
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
不过我马上要去参加一个预算会议
but l do have a budget meeting l need to run to.

127
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,030
卡特先生，你还需要我们做什么吗？
Mr. Carter, is there anything you need from us?

128
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,610
我只需要你们把这份文件复印二十五份
Well, l just need about 25 copies of this document.

129
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,480
- 就这样  - 雷，你能不能帮
- l'm all set.  - Ray, would you see to it

130
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,840
卡特先生…卡特教练准备好复印件？
that Mr. Carter...? Coach Carter gets these copies?

131
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,520
- 好的  - 失陪了
- Will do.  - Gentlemen.

132
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,550
我不能说这不会是一次挑战
l'm not saying this is not gonna be a challenge,

133
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,220
不过，肯尼，你是知道的
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

134
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,420
你只要记住，这些都是好孩子
Just keep in mind, these are good boys.

135
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,890
各位！各位！
Guys! Guys!

136
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,690
各位！
Guys!

137
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,200
现在，你们都知道，我一直…嘿！
Now, as you know, l've been... Hey!

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
你们知道我一直在物色一个新教练
You know l've been looking for a new coach

139
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,300
在这个赛季接替我
to take over for me this season.

140
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,000
这是肯·卡特，他曾经在里士满上学
This is Ken Carter. He went to Richmond.

141
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,740
他是两届全美明星
He was a two-sport all-American.

142
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,250
现在还保持着得分、助攻、抢断的纪录
Still holds records for scoring, assists, steals.

143
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,890
在乔治·梅森大学拿过篮球奖学金
Basketball scholarship to George Mason University.

144
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,210
我们能请到卡特教练是很幸运的
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

145
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,420
现在咱们给他应得的尊敬吧
Now, let's give him the respect he's due.

146
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,060
- 他们都是你的了，教练  - 谢谢，先生
- They're all yours, coach.  - Thank you, sir.

147
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,160
下午好，年轻人
Good afternoon, young men.

148
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,240
怀特教练已经说过，我是你们的新任篮球教练肯·卡特
As Coach White said, l'm your new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

149
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,210
看来我得再大点声才能让你们听见
l guess l need to speak louder so you can hear me.

150
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,840
我是肯·卡特，你们的新任篮球教练
l'm Ken Carter, your new basketball coach.

151
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,340
我们听见了，小子，不过我们看不见你
We hear you, dog. But we can't see you.

152
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,040
你那个又大又黑的秃头
The glare from your big, black-ass head

153
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,220
太晃眼了，哥们，妈的，你是不是拿布把它擦亮了？
is hella shiny, man. Damn, do you buff it?

154
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,790
哦，你除了会那么难看的跳投，还会说笑话，唔？
Oh, you got jokes to go along with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

155
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,490
第一，如果你们想知道我的资历
First of all, if you need to know my credentials,

156
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,060
是不是像怀特教练说的那样，你们背后的墙上就是证明
as Coach White said, they're on the wall there behind you.

157
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:09,900
第二，如果篮球练习是三点开始，那么在两点五十五以后来的都是迟到了
Secondly, if basketball practice starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

158
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,670
你，投篮的那个，你叫什么名字，先生？
You, shooting the ball. What's your name, sir?

159
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,810
杰森·莱尔，不过我不是什么先生
Jason Lyle, but l ain't no sir.

160
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,410
你不是先生
You're not a sir.

161
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,640
哦，那你是女士啰？
Well, are you a madam?

162
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,050
- 小婊子，婊子  - 从现在起，你就是先生
- Little bitch. Bitch.  - As of now, you are a sir.

163
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,950
你们其他人也是
So are the rest of you.

164
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,720
“先生”是表示尊敬
"Sir" is a term of respect.

165
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,490
只要你们不滥用我的尊敬，我就会对你们尊敬
And you will have my respect until you abuse it.

166
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,120
莱尔先生，你们上个赛季赢了几场比赛？
Mr. Lyle, how many games did you guys win last season?

167
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,460
大概是四胜二十二负
Like four wins, 22 losses.

168
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,930
- 先生  - 先生
- Sir.  - Sir.

169
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,710
我要给你们一份合同
l'm going to give you contracts.

170
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,550
如果你们签字，并且履行这上面规定的义务
lf you sign and honor your side of them,

171
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,910
我们就会成功
we are going to be successful.

172
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,550
妈的，我签这合同能拿到签字奖励吗？
Damn, do l get a signing bonus for signing this contract?

173
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,520
会的，先生，你会成为赢家
Yes, sir. You get to become a winner.

174
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,690
因为如果说我知道什么事的话，那件事就是…
Because if there's one thing l know, it is this:

175
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,630
失败到此为止了
The losing stops now.

176
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,160
从现在起，你们会像赢家一样打球，像赢家一样生活
Starting today, you will play like winners, act like winners,

177
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,210
最重要的是，你们将会是赢家
and most importantly, you will be winners.

178
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,940
如果你们肯听肯学，就会打赢篮球比赛
lf you listen and learn, you'll win basketball games.

179
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,440
先生们，在这里赢…
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

180
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,150
…正是在外面赢的关键
...is the key to winning out there.

181
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,080
这份合同规定你们的总平均成绩要保持在二点三分以上
This contract states that you will maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

182
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,120
你们要去上你们的所有课程
You will attend all your classes

183
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,090
而且要坐在前排
and you will sit in the front row of those classes.

184
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,960
- 嚯，这是个乡下蠢黑鬼，小子  - 打扰一下
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.  - Excuse me.

185
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,830
- 你刚才说了什么吗，先生？ - 沃姆想知道
- Did you say something, sir?  - Worm was wondering,

186
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,970
看你打的领带还有这副派头，你是不是什么乡下教会里的黑鬼？
are you some country church nigga, with your tie on and all that?

187
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,760
- 对  - 这就是你想说的，对吗？
- Right.  - That's what you wanna say, right?

188
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,200
你叫什么名字，先生？
And what is your name, sir?

189
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,440
我叫提摩·克鲁兹，先生
l'm Timo Cruz, sir.

190
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,840
好，克鲁兹先生，还有沃姆先生
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

191
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,550
你们两个都要知道，我们是有自尊的
what you should both know is we treat ourselves with respect.

192
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,190
我们不会使用“黑鬼”这个词
We don't use the word "nigga."

193
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,290
你是传教士还是什么狗屁？
Are you some preacher man or some shit?

194
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,720
因为上帝在这一带可不会给你们什么好果子吃
Because God ain't gonna do you no good in this neighborhood.

195
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,020
- 我就住在这一带，先生  - 先生
- l live in this neighborhood, sir.  - Sir.

196
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,220
你们能相信这个傲慢的黑炭头吗，先生？
Can you believe this uppity Negro, sir?

197
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,420
好吧，克鲁兹先生…
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

198
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,040
- …马上离开体育馆  - 为什么？
- ...leave the gym right now.  - For what?

199
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,070
我最后说一次，请你离开体育馆
l'll ask you one last time to leave the gym

200
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,800
- 不然我就帮你离开  - 不然你就什么？
- before l help you leave.  - Before you what?

201
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,640
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you even know who l am?

202
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,380
从我看到的来说，你是一个非常慌张和害怕的年轻人
From what l can see, a very confused and scared young man.

203
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,990
害怕谁？怕你吗？我应该怕你吗？
Scared of who? Scared of you? l'm supposed to be scared of you?

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,260
黑鬼，我谁都不怕，我要把你打个半死
Nigga, l ain't scared of nobody. l will lay your ass out.

205
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,720
我可不这么想
l don't think so.

206
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,220
好吧
All right.

207
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,140
你干什么？放开我！
What you doing? Get off me!

208
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,170
老师不应该对学生动粗的
Teachers ain't supposed to touch students.

209
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,180
我不是老师
l'm not a teacher.

210
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,770
我是你的新任篮球教练
l'm your new basketball coach.

211
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,660
这事没完！
This ain't over!

212
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,110
还有谁不同意这份合同的？
ls there anybody else who's not feeling this contract?

213
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,710
哥们，你去哪儿？
Come on, man, where you going?

214
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,180
我不签什么高中合同
l don't do high school contracts.

215
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,860
等你需要真正的球员时，跟我们说
Tell us when you need the real ballers.

216
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,150
我会的，先生
l will do that, sir.

217
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,850
我们上赛季最好的两个得分手走了
There goes our two leading scorers from last season, man.

218
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,220
那么我猜这个赛季我们会有新的得分手了？
Then l guess we'll have new leading scorers this season, huh?

219
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,260
现在我还不能教你们怎么打比赛
Now, l cannot teach you the game of basketball

220
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,460
等你们的身体素质达到允许我教的水平才行
until your conditioning is at a level that allows me to do so.

221
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,840
先生们，到底线站好
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

222
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,150
到底线去！
To the baseline!

223
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,350
我猜你们都知道“自杀”是怎么一回事
l presume you all know what suicides are.

224
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,790
所以…
So...

225
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,290
那天晚上我看了和圣弗朗西斯队的比赛
l saw the St. Francis game the other night.

226
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,530
你们的投篮都没问题
None of you have a problem shooting the ball.

227
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,400
但是你们在球场上的跑动都有问题
You all had a problem getting up and down the court.

228
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,340
如果你们迟到了，就得给我跑步
lf you are late, you will run.

229
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,380
要是你们给我脸色看，那就要做俯卧撑
lf you give me attitude, you will do push-ups.

230
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,720
所以，要么做俯卧撑，要么闭嘴
So you can push-up or shut up.

231
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,390
你们自己挑
That's up to you.

232
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,020
- 喂，我们要跑多少？ - 先生
- Yo, how many we gonna do?  - Sir.

233
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,720
喂，先生，我们要跑多少？
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

234
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,990
咱们看看你们在一小时零七分钟里能跑多少
Let's see how many you can do in one hour and seven minutes.

235
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,570
小伙子们，给我好好做
Fellas, don't make me commit homicide.

236
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,310
我说了，是“自杀”！用你们的手碰线！
l said, suicides! Put your hand on the line!

237
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,380
用你们的手碰线！
Put your hand on the line!

238
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,550
妈的，我撑不下去了，我连路都快走不动了
Damn, l can't keep this shit up, man. l can barely walk.

239
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,210
- 我明白，我的腿也痛得要死  - 我要喝点佳得乐什么的
- l know, my legs is hella sore, son.  - Need some Gatorade or something.

240
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,380
- 你的女友就在那里  - 对
- There go your girl right there, son.  - Yeah.

241
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,150
嘿，你和你的妞又怎么样？你要对她们诉苦吗？
Hey, what's with you and her homeys? You gonna try to holler at them?

242
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,560
我要对两个朋友都诉苦
Man, l'm hollering at both of the friends.

243
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,360
- 两个？ - 对，因为我需要
- Both of them?  - Yeah, because l need that.

244
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,560
要知道，我的生活需要多样性，我不能只有一个女孩
You know, l need variety in my life. l can't just have one girl.

245
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,130
明白我的话吗？两个我都要
You know what l'm saying? l need both.

246
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,570
嘿
Hey.

247
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,030
- 怎么样，宝贝儿？ - 你好吗？
- What's up, baby?  - How you doing?

248
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,400
女士们，女士们，女士们，你们都听说过二对一特别版吧？
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard about that two-for-one special, right?

249
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,510
你们两个，我一个，这就是特别的地方
Two of you, one of me. Now, that's special.

250
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,410
- 求你了，随你怎样，沃姆  - 对，特别版
- Please. Whatever, Worm.  - Yeah, special ed.

251
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,210
- 别搂着我  - 我喜欢这狐皮
- Get your arm off me.  - l like this fox.

252
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,850
你就像栗鼠，不过你看，宝贝儿，我和你…
You working that chinchilla. But, look, baby, me and you...

253
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,620
你应该告诉他别做出那么亲热的样子，她甚至都不喜欢他
You need to tell him to stop playing it so close. She don't even like him.

254
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,760
[Worm：虫子；蠕虫]
- 为什么不呢？沃姆是好人  - 沃姆是“虫子”
- Why not? Worm's the man.  - Worm is Worm.

255
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,060
不管怎样，我今天给宝宝买了件东西
Anyway, l got something for the baby today.

256
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,270
我们还不知道是不是宝宝呢，我是说，现在还早了点
We don't even know if it's a baby yet. l mean, it's kind of early.

257
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,180
你还没去看过医生呢
You ain't even been to the doctor yet.

258
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,450
喂，我做过怀孕测试了，凯尼恩，做过三次呢
Hello? l passed the pregnancy test, Kenyon. Three times.

259
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,690
- 不过这还蛮可爱的  - 我知道，我品位很高的，对吧？
- These are kind of cute, though.  - l know, l got good taste, right?

260
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,370
对，好的
Yeah, all right.

261
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,560
精致的小鞋子
Precious little shoes.

262
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,830
哦，我还给你买了件小东西
Well, l got a little somethin'-somethin' for you too.

263
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,730
谢谢
Thank you.

264
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,680
这还真是件小东西
This definitely is a little something.

265
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,080
- 你哪儿搞来的？ - 我在九十九分商店工作不是光睡觉的
- Where'd you get this?  - Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

266
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,820
凯尼恩！
Kenyon!

267
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,290
- 怎么？怎么了？ - 你干什么呀？给我！
- What? What's up?  - What are you doing? Give me!

268
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,320
- 你疯了吗？ - 你疯了吗？
- Are you crazy?  - Are you crazy?

269
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,090
这是你花九十九美分买的？我去过那里
You got that for 99 cents? l've been there.

270
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,230
九十九美分可以买三把扫帚和一个水桶，外加一点卫生纸
You can get three brooms and a bucket for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

271
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,370
这东西细得像根线儿一样，还没半根鞋带大呢
That's like thread. That's not even half a shoelace.

272
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,100
哦，那你想不想看我穿上这鞋带？
Well, would you like to see me in this shoelace?

273
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,100
脚步快点！让我看到快速的脚步！
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

274
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,010
要碰地板！动作大！要大！
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

275
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,840
三个俯卧撑，马上做，一！二！三！
Three push-ups and move. One! Two! Three!

276
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,850
快点，跳！
Let's go. Explode!

277
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,350
让我听见，要让我听见！让我听见
Let me hear you. Let me hear you! Let me hear it.

278
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,750
跳！沃姆，跳！
Explode! Worm, explode!

279
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,320
要碰地板！要碰地板！
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

280
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,590
给我做五下！只要给我做五下！做！
Give me five! Just give me five! Push!

281
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,820
做！快！快！要让我听见！
Push! Go! Go! Let me hear you!

282
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,230
快！封线！跳！快啊！
Come on, close out! Explode! Let's go!

283
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,530
先生，你迟到了二十分钟
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

284
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,140
那么全队要“自杀”十次，你要做两百五十个俯卧撑
That's ten suicides for the whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

285
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,780
这里不是田径队，老兄
This ain't the track team, man.

286
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,410
也不是辩论队，莱尔先生
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

287
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,110
不过你是对的
But you're right.

288
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,450
因为你是对的，所以全队要“自杀”二十次
And because you're right, that's 20 suicides for the entire team

289
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,820
而你获得了跟巴特尔先生一起
and you get the privilege of joining Mr. Battle

290
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,860
- 做你自己的两百五十下俯卧撑的特权  - 什么，你是认真的？
- with 250 push-ups of your own.  - What, are you serious?

291
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,820
- 对  - 这真是狗屎！
- Yeah.  - This is bullshit!

292
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,660
回答得好！巴特尔先生
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

293
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,390
强尼，告诉他，他得了什么奖
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

294
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,040
因为你回答得这么好
Because you gave such a good answer

295
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,760
而且你跟教练顶嘴
and you gave the coach attitude,

296
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,500
所以你赢得了五百个俯卧撑的奖励！
you win the bonus prize of 500 push-ups!

297
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,950
你还想赢一千个俯卧撑的大奖吗？
And would you like to go for the grand prize of a thousand?

298
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,380
不，先生
No, sir.

299
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,350
到底线去！听我的哨！快！
To the baseline! On my whistle! Let's go!

300
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,350
巴特尔，够了，宝贝儿
J.B., come on, baby.

301
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,380
我动都动不了了，我身上每块肌肉都受伤了
l can't even move, son. Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

302
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,530
- 你跟他不能讲理  - 为什么我跟他不能讲理？
- You can't say nothing to him.  - Why can't l say nothing to him?

303
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,020
我是白人吗？老兄，到底…？
l'm a white boy? Man, what the...?

304
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,320
就是这，就是这，抓住这小子，抓住这小子
Right here. Right here. Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

305
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,690
你往哪儿跑？你往哪儿跑，嗯？
Where you going, homey? Where you going, huh?

306
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,060
- 我什么都没有  - 什么？
- l ain't got shit.  - What?

307
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,740
别开枪，老兄，把我的包拿去吧，哥们！
Please don't shoot me, man. Go on, take my bag, dog!

308
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,910
你跑啊，哥们！
Run your shit, homey!

309
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,380
搞什么搞！克鲁兹！
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

310
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,050
能坐牢的，小子
Yo, l'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

311
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,950
开个玩笑而已，老兄，瞧你那样！
l'm just playing, B. Look at you!

312
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,330
妈的！我看见你们都从街上走过来
Damn! l seen y'all walking from up the block

313
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,020
好像有人拿铁管捅了你们的屁眼一样
like somebody put a pipe in your asses.

314
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,270
你们都好吧？
You all right, dog?

315
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,100
你们和我在一起的时候没赢过
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

316
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,830
可是现在没了我，你们他妈的肯定很惨
but y'all damn sure look sad without me.

317
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,100
不过你们知道吗？我会看你们比赛的
But you know what? l'm gonna watch y'all play.

318
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,740
看你们挨整
See y'all get your asses kicked.

319
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,240
喂！你今晚没时间和你们废话，我可得走了
Yo! l'd love to shoot the shit with you bitches all night, but l gotta go.

320
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,740
- 好吧  - 喂，那是谁？
- All right.  - Yo, who that, man?

321
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,680
是我表哥瑞尼
That's my cousin, Renny.

322
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,440
我会来看你们的，来吧，咱们走
l'm gonna check y'all. Come on, let's go.

323
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,590
沃姆，你要搭车吗？
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

324
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,150
- 不了，我没事儿  - 你肯定？
- No, l'm straight, man.  - You sure?

325
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,190
- 对，我很好  - 好吧，老兄
- Yeah, l'm good.  - All right, my nigga.

326
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,590
- 好  - 好吧，莱尔！
- One love.  - All right, Lyle!

327
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,750
别再让人拿管子捅你的屁眼了，要不你可能会喜欢那样的！
Don't let nobody else put a pipe up your ass, or you might like it!

328
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,610
嘿，你被吓到了吧？我可没被吓到
Hey, you was scared, huh? l wasn't scared.

329
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,500
本州的规定只要求他们的平均成绩达到两分就能打球
The state only requires that they have a 2.0 average to play.

330
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,200
你这里却要他们达到两点三分
Now, you got in here they need a 2.3.

331
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,710
如果你平均成绩两分，就至少要在高考时拿到一千零五十分
lf you have a 2.0, you have to score at least 1 050 on the SAT

332
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,440
才有可能获得运动员奖学金
to be eligible for an athletic scholarship.

333
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,950
如果你平均成绩二点三分，那就只需要九百五十分
lf you have a 2.3, you only need 950.

334
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,820
二点三分只不过是C+
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

335
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,020
保持C+不会那么困难的
lt shouldn't be that hard to maintain a C-plus.

336
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,590
这些孩子是学生运动员
These boys are student athletes.

337
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,790
“学生”是首要的
"Student" comes first.

338
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,490
这上面还要他们在比赛日穿西装打领带
lt says they gotta wear coat and ties on game days.

339
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,230
他们连领带都没有！你打算提供领带？
They don't own ties! You gonna supply the ties?

340
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,500
离这里不到两个街区
There's a Goodwill and a Salvation Army store

341
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,730
就有一家亲善商店和一家救世军店
less than two blocks from here.

342
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,410
他们那里有满满一箱五十美分一条的领带
They got a box full of ties for 50 cents apiece.

343
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,480
老兄，你想说什么，嗯？
Yo, man, what you trying to say, huh?

344
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,140
我们身份太高，不能去亲善店和救世军店买东西，是吗？
Oh, we too good to shop at the Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

345
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,750
- 对，我还没穷成那样  - 这真是疯了！
- Yeah, l ain't that broke.  - This is crazy!

346
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,850
规定着装，还规定他们坐在前排上课？
A dress code and they have to sit in the front row in class?

347
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,820
- 这是打篮球啊，老兄！ - 篮球是一项特权，夫人
- This is basketball, man!  - And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

348
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,960
如果你想在这个队打篮球
lf you want to play basketball on this team,

349
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,890
这就是你要遵守的简单规则
these are the simple rules you have to follow

350
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,830
假如你要享受这种特权的话
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

351
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,370
好，如果你们决定遵守这些简单规则
Now, if you decide to follow these simple rules,

352
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,400
我就要你们和孩子们签这份合同
l need you and the boys to sign this contract.

353
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,540
他们明天带着合同来训练
They can bring the contracts to practice tomorrow.

354
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,650
如果来训练的话
lf you come to practice.

355
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,040
我要谢谢你们大家来这里表示支持
l wanna thank you all for coming out and showing your support,

356
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,160
我希望在这个赛季余下的时间里，也能得到你们的支持
and l hope l have your support the rest of the season.

357
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,150
- 晚安  - 就这么走了？
- Good night.  - Get up and leave like that?

358
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,590
我已经费了很大功夫把我侄子…
Look, l have a hard enough time getting my nephew to...

359
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,060
- 你打算怎么让他们打领带？ - 我要那个老教练回来！
- How you gonna make them wear ties?  - l want the other coach back!

360
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,370
这是你的一份合同，先生，我修改了一下
lt's one of your contracts, sir. l've amended that contract.

361
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,840
你要求你的球员保持二点三分的平均成绩
You require your players to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

362
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,680
我保证保持在三点五分以上
l've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

363
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,120
你要求做十个小时的社区服务，我保证做五十个小时
You require ten hours of community service, and l've committed to 50.

364
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,530
如果在学校里发生任何未经允许的缺席或其他纪律问题
Any unexcused absences, any other disciplinary issues at school,

365
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,900
你都可以使本协议作废，送我去任何你希望的学校
you can nullify this agreement and send me to any school you want.

366
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,140
我有几天时间来考虑这份提议？
And how many days do l have to consider this offer?

367
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,710
就今天
None.

368
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,500
第二页是一封你必须签字的信
The second page is a letter you need to sign

369
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,800
确认我从圣弗朗西斯高中退学
that confirms my withdrawal from St. Francis.

370
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,440

- 朱尼尔·巴特尔  - 保持不败直到…
- Junior Battle.  - Undefeated until...

496
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,600
哥们，说真的
Yo, man, on the real,

497
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,670
这是我这辈子见过的最难看的比赛
that was the worst game l've ever seen in my life.

498
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,340
我还以为这烂球永远不会结束呢，我在看台上都要死了
l thought that shit would never end. l was dying in the bleachers.

499
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,510
对啊，你是在看台上，不是吗？
That's right, you were in the bleachers, weren't you?

500
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,270
而我们是在场上干我们的事
We were on the court handling our business.

501
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,710
对啊，我们一比零，小子
That's right. We 1 -0, bitch.

502
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,510
说真的，大力神队很弱，老兄，你们是勉强打败他们的
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B, and y'all barely beat them.

503
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,580
妈的，提摩，你干吗要说风凉话？
Damn, Timo, why you throwing salt, man?

504
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,450
我们没输，说点好话吧，小子
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

505
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,520
对，说得对，我们没输
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

506
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,720
我要把你们都打趴下
l'll knock all y'all off.

507
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,820
- 回头再找你们，好吗？ - 好
- Yo. l'll check y'all later, all right?  - All right.

508
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,590
来干吧
Yo. Let's do this.

509
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,870
- 怎么样？ - 这里有两包
- What's up?  - Here's two bundles.

510
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,840
- 好的  - 当心点，街上风声很紧
- All right.  - Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

511
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,570
我明白
Yo, l got you.

512
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,020
- 你好吗，老弟？ - 很害怕
- How you doing, man?  - Chilling, man.

513
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,080
你看起来气色不错
You look good.

514
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,610
给你带了点钱
Got some paper for you.

515
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,180
好样儿的
Now we're talking, yeah.

516
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,760
你过得怎样，提摩？
How you living, Timo?

517
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,100
我很好
l'm good.

518
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,830
- 你很好？真的？ - 对
- You all right? For real?  - Yeah.

519
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,170
- 给，拿点去  - 我很好
- Here, take some.  - l'm all right.

520
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,340
不，不，不，请你拿着吧
No, no, no, take some, please.

521
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,340
你真的很好，干得很棒，兄弟
You did good, man. You're doing good, bro.

522
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,070
- 谢谢你  - 别谢我，谢你自己
- Thank you.  - Don't thank me, thank you.

523
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,880
这是你挣的
You earned it.

524
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,250
去吸点海洛因
Take a nickel bag, okay?

525
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,520
去给自己买点东西吧
Go get yourself something, man.

526
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,160
- 以后再见？ - 对，下礼拜
- l'm gonna see you?  - Yeah, next week.

527
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,490
好，以后再见
Okay, l'm gonna see you.

528
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,230
- 好好干  - 好
- Keep it up.  - Yeah.

529
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,050
嘿，莎夸，德尼丝，冲我发牢骚吧
Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.

530
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,220
拉菲卡，我瞧见你在看
Rafeca, l see you looking.

531
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,330
没人会想着你，沃姆
Ain't nobody thinking about you, Worm.

532
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,430
- 哦，好  - 先生们
- Oh, okay.  - Gentlemen,

533
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,560
我们来回顾一下和大力神队的比赛好么？
let's review the Hercules game, shall we?

534
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,600
好，把我的数据大声说出来吧，先生
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

535
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,030
沃姆先生，你是五和四
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

536
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,430
不对，先生，我得了十二分和八次助攻，先生
No, sir. l had 1 2 points and eight assists, sir.

537
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,100
不，先生，沃姆先生，你得了五次失误，还罚失了四个球
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five turnovers and four missed free throws.

538
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,280
现在，我们要谈谈基本功
Now, we're talking about fundamentals here.

539
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,040
我要在每天早上六点加一次训练，直到我们掌握基本功为止
Until we learn them, l'm adding a practice every morning at 6 a.m.

540
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,380
- 早上六点？ - 我们的命中率是百分之五十六…
- Six a.m.?  - We shot 56 percent at...

541
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,720
克鲁兹先生
Mr. Cruz.

542
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,560
你迷路了吗，先生？
Are you lost, sir?

543
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,220
我要做什么才能打球？
What l gotta do to play?

544
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,600
克鲁兹先生，你不会想知道这个问题的答案的
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know the answer to that question.

545
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,000
好，我刚才说了
Now, as l was saying,

546
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:38,040
我们全队在罚球线上的命中率是百分之五十六
as a team, we shot 56 percent from the line.

547
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,040
从现在起，在你们离开体育馆前
From now on, before you leave my gym,

548
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,510
你们要练五十次罚球作为出门费
you must pay an exit price of 50 made free throws before you can go.

549
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,550
- 什么？ - 每个人都是这样
- What?  - That's everybody.

550
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,880
- 真是的  - 那可是好多次罚球啊
- Come on.  - That's a lot of free throws.

551
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,730
好吧，克鲁兹先生
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

552
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,230
在你能到这个队打球之前…
Before you can play on this team...

553
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,400
…你要给我做…
...you owe me...

554
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,170
…两千五百个俯卧撑…
...2,500 push-ups...

555
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,000
…还有一千次自杀
...and 1 ,000 suicides.

556
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,900
- 妈的  - 妈的
- Damn.  - Damn.

557
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,780
而且到星期五必须完成
And they must be completed by Friday.

558
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,780
- 到星期五他做不完的  - 他做不完的
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.  - He ain't making that.

559
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,910
今天的加料是：进攻
Today's flavor: offense.

560
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,090
- 这还不错  - 我有一个姐姐
- Now we talking.  - Now, l have a sister.

561
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,450
她叫琳达
Her name is Linda.

562
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,130
琳达很聪明，对政治很热衷
Linda is smart, she's political.

563
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,530
哦，实际上，她很激进
Well, actually, she's radical.

564
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,460
琳达留着很大的非洲式发型
Linda's got a big Afro.

565
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,540
琳达就是我们的挡拆进攻
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

566
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,070
在我们联系挡拆前，先热热身
Before we get into that, let's warm up.

567
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,340
排成上篮的队形
Give me a lay-up line.

568
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,450
- 上吧  - 好
- Let's go.  - All right.

569
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,310
咱们干吧
Let's do it.

570
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,250
- 妈的，他有几个姐姐？ - 谁知道
- Damn, how many sisters he got?  - Who knows.

571
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,280
- 快，这边再来两个  - 爆发
- Come on, get two more over here.  - Break it out.

572
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,820
- 咱们上，各位  - 活力，各位，活力
- Let's go, guys.  - Energy, guys, energy.

573
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,510
我们有活力，上啊
We got this, let's go.

574
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,060
- 我这边空了  - 我接他，我接他
- l'm open.  - l got him, l got him.

575
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,820
这边，这边，我这边空了，我这边空了
Right here, right here. l'm open. l'm open.

576
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,330
对不起
l'm sorry.

577
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,550
- 好了  - 嘿，嘿，嘿
- All right.  - Hey, hey, hey.

578
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,860
- 得了  - 这不是我的错
- Come on.  - lt's not my fault.

579
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,260
- 他太早了  - 嘿
- He was early.  - Hey.

580
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,130
对，无球跑动很重要
Yes, it's important to move without the ball,

581
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,170
但是你应该耐心等待
but you gotta be patient on the weak-side screen.

582
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,400
虚晃一下，然侯从他肩旁冲过，明白？
Set up your man and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

583
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,740
好，交换
Okay. Switch it up.

584
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,380
轮到我们了，来吧，咱们上，搞定它
We got it, come on. Let's go. Let's get it.

585
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,520
- 叫他们掩护  - 对，对，好的
- And call out them picks.  - Yeah, yeah, all right.

586
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,860
你心中最怕是什么，克鲁兹先生？
What is your deepest fear, Mr. Cruz?

587
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,620
别人看不起你？
That you're inadequate?

588
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,590
放弃吧，克鲁兹先生
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

589
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,930
回家去
Go home.

590
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,240
好，我要求你们在投篮前传七次
All right, l want seven passes before you shoot.

591
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,140
- 七次  - 好
- Seven.  - All right.

592
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,440
- 我接他，我接他  - 到那里接球
- l got him. l got him.  - Get that ball in there.

593
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,550
你知道你的任务在星期五以前不可能完成了，对吗？
You know your task is impossible before Friday, right?

594
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,120
动起来
Move.

595
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,420
做好，做好
Work it, work it.

596
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,990
跑回去
Run it back.

597
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,390
你妈妈什么时候回家？
What time your mom getting home?

598
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,350
她还要一个小时
She doesn't get off for another hour.

599
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,230
哦，那是迈尔斯
Oh, that's Myles.

600
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,230
什么？
What?

601
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,510
说：“你好，凯尼恩叔叔”
Say, "Hi, Uncle Kenyon."

602
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,480
说：“你好”
Say, "Hi."

603
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,950
好了，别担心
All right, don't worry about it.

604
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,720
他喝完奶就又会睡了
He'll go back to sleep right after his bottle.

605
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,150
对吗，宝宝？
Right, boo-boo?

606
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,730
对，到时可能你妈也回来了
Yeah, probably in time for your mom to get home.

607
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,400
或是在你表姐烫染好头发回家的时候
Or when your cousin get back from getting her hair fried and dyed,

608
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,300
好像她负担得起这些屁玩意，再怎么说这也是她的孩子
like she can afford all that shit. lt's her baby anyway.

609
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,700
我妈妈不得不两班倒
Well, my mother had to work a double shift,

610
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,460
可他们还克扣了她的加班费
but they cut her overtime.

611
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,970
至于我表姐么，别瞧不起她
And my cousin, don't be trying to dis her.

612
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,940
你说我们可以独处，这就叫独处？
You said we'd be alone. You call this alone?

613
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,910
所以说我们需要自己的窝么
Well, that's why we need our own spot.

614
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,850
这是你关的？
Did you turn this off?

615
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,250
- 对，都烧开了  - 哎呀，真是的
- Yeah, it was boiling.  - Oh, come on.

616
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,320
把它关小，别关掉呀
Well, turn it down, not off.

617
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,330
这是牛奶、黄油加干酪，我们可浪费不起
This is milk, butter and cheese. We can't afford to waste this.

618
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,860
你抱着他
And hold him up.

619
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,510
给迈尔斯准备婴儿奶瓶
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

620
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,610
好的，迈尔斯，来吧
All right, Myles, here we go.

621
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,280
得先凉一会儿
Gotta cool off a minute.

622
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,980
有没有想过在你怀孕前我们该干什么？
Ever think about what you were gonna do before you were pregnant?

623
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,390
你是指什么，去上大学吗？
What you mean, going to junior college?

等你有了孩子就得去找些工作

628

为什么你老是问个没完？
Why you asking me all these questions?

631
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,400
再说你应该把手放在他的臂膀下面

632
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,440
你应该让他靠在你胸前，抱住他
You gotta sit him on your chest. Hold him.

633
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,050
- 我是抱着他呀  - 你抱得不对
- l am holding him.  - You ain't doing it right.

634
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,740
你应该哄哄他，凯尼恩

635

瞧…

我不知道怎么做这种事
l don't know how to do this.

637

你会学会的

638
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,800

我要去帮我妈妈办点事
Look, l gotta help my mom with some stuff.

好，让球一直传

嘿，嘿，嘿

You don't get to your man, stand, watch the ball.

球起来的时候，要抢到好的防守位置
When the ball goes up, get in good defensive position,

652
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,270

Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling a very different story.

卡特先生，孩子们怎样？

要我帮什么忙吗？
How may l help you?

663
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,930
嗯，我让孩子们签了合同
Well, l had my boys sign contracts

664
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,800
要求他们的学习达到某些标准
requiring them to meet certain academic standards.

665
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,640
对，有个教员说起过
Yes, l believe one of the faculty members mentioned that.

666
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,710
非常有趣的恐吓战术
Very interesting scare tactic.

667
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,780
为了使这一措施成功

668
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,640
我要求他们的老师每周填写一份学习进程报告
l need their teachers to fill out weekly progress reports

669

什么也没收到
from their teachers.

672
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,130
我不明白这和您的篮球教练工作有什么联系，卡特先生
l don't see how this ties in to your job as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

673
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,200
哦，我接下这份工作的时候，就认为我可以用自己的方式来干
Well, l took this job with the understanding l could do it my way.

674
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,800

我对你的成果很吃惊
l'm impressed with what you've done.

688
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,580
但是你做得还不够
But you came up short.

689
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,590
你还欠我八十次自杀和五百个俯卧撑
You owe me 80 suicides and 500 push-ups.

690
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,660

我来替他做俯卧撑

你说过我们是一支团队
You said we're a team.

695
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,610
有一个人拼命，我们就都要拼命
One person struggles, we all struggle.

696
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,840
一个队员胜利，就是我们大家的胜利，对吗？
One player triumphs, we all triumph, right?

697
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,990

去吧

三分，克鲁兹！

你们开始羞辱对手了
No, you have to humiliate your opponent.

每次得分以后都要嘲弄他们

758
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,160
来玷污我热爱的比赛？
with trash talk and taunting?

759
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,670
凭什么你们可以穿着里士满队的球衣
What gives you the right to wear Richmond on your chests

760
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,970
却摆出一幅流氓腔？
and act like punks?

761
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,610
- 教练，他们也在骂人  - 那又怎样？
- Coach, they were jawing too.  - So?

762
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,440
你们就不能有点风度？
You can't show some class?

763
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,080
不能拿出冠军的气量？
Act like a champion?

764
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,750
你们每人欠我五百个俯卧撑
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

765
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,650
排成一排，快
On the line. Now.

766
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,850
- 妈的  - 哦，老兄，得了
- Damn.  - Oh, man, come on.

767
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,010
听我说，小家伙，我只想跟你说实话，好吗？
Listen, shorty, l'm just gonna be real with you, okay?

768
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,370
你是我的姑娘
You're my girl.

769
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,980
我从那球场出来的时候好像一切都疯了
l get out on that court and everything is just getting crazy,

770
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,920
我只会做一件事，就是想你
all l gotta do is just think about you.

771
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,320
莱尔先生
Mr. Lyle.

772
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,390
为什么你不在上…
Why aren't you in...

773
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,230
- …几何课？ - 我马上就去，先生
- ...geometry?  - l'm going there right now, sir.

774
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,930
- 先生，这是贝蒂  - 贝拉
- Sir, this is Betty.  - Bella.

775
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,000
贝拉，贝拉，这是贝拉，先生
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

776
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,790
上课去
Go to class.

777
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,350
别忘了这些项目要在本周末交
Don't forget that these projects are due at the end of this week.

778
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,780
- 所以如果你们有谁还需要更多时间…  - 打扰一下，先生，你是盖瑟克先生吗？
- So if any of you need extra time...  - Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

779
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,080
- 是的  - 我…
- Yes.  - l...

780
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,380
…在这班上没看到朱尼尔·巴特尔
...don't see Junior Battle in this class.

781
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,490
朱尼尔·巴特尔就像日食
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

782
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,680
我们很少见到他，如果见到了，那一定很不寻常
We rarely see him, but when we do, it's always special.

783
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,230
谢谢
Thank you.

784
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,960
“本次投票中意外进榜的是排在第十九位的里士满高中”
"Surprise arrival to the poll is Richmond High at 1 9th."

785
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,870
- 二十强啊，宝贝儿  - 我们在第十九位，哥们
- Top 20, baby.  - We're 1 9th, dog.

786
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,340
油井队取得了九场全胜的战绩
"The Oilers have posted a perfect 9-0 mark,

787
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,530
他们战胜的包括传统强队
winning on the road against perennial powerhouses

788
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,140
泽维尔和巴克斯特联盟”
Xavier and Baxter Union."

789
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,840
朱尼尔，剩下的应该你来读
Junior, you should read the rest of this.

790
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,850
他们在这报纸上把你吹捧了一把
They blowing you up in this paper.

791
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,420
- 快啊，老兄，读吧  - 你知道他读不来
- Come on, man, read it.  - Man, you know he can't read.

792
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,320
- 闭嘴  - 闭嘴，马德克斯
- Man, shut up.  - Shut up, Maddux.

793
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,960
里士满中心巍然耸立，因为“掌起”油井队的
"Richmond center has been big as the Oilers are 'boyed."'

794
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,100
“撑起”，那个字念“撑”
Buoyed. The word is "buoyed."

795
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,770
撑起油井队的是朱尼尔·巴特尔，平均每晚的十九点八个篮板
"Buoyed by Junior Battle's 1 9.8-rebound-a-night numbers."

796
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,640
瞧，这就是我的大个黑鬼，小子，嘿
See, that's my big nigga right there, son. Hey.

797
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,320
如果你再长大点，你就是我的大大个黑鬼
lf you was any bigger, you'd be my bigger nigga.

798
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,980
坐下，坐下！
Sit down. Sit down!

799
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,330
“黑鬼”是用来侮辱我们祖先的贬义词
"Nigger" is a derogatory term used to insult our ancestors.

800
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,400
要明白，如果有白人用这个词，你就要准备还击
See, if a white man used it, you'd be ready to fight.

801
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,440
你们用这个词就是在教他也用
Your using it teaches him to use it.

802
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,630
你们可能会说这样很酷，这样一点都不酷
You're saying it's cool. Well, it's not cool.

803
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,110
当你们在我身边的时候，我不想听到这个狗屁词
And when you're around me, l don't wanna hear that shit.

804
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,880
- 明白吗？ - 是的，先生
- We clear?  - Yes, sir.

805
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,520
- 是的，先生  - 是的，先生
- Yes, sir.  - Yes, sir.

806
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,020
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

807
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,450
沃姆先生
Mr. Worm,

808
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,130
你在这个篮球赛季想得到什么？
what is it you want out of this basketball season?

809
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,960
拿到州冠军，先生
To win that state championship, sir.

810
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,190
好，那么上个赛季是谁拿到了州冠军呢，莱尔？
Well, who won the state basketball championship last season, Lyle?

811
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,470
我要知道就见鬼了，先生
Hell if l know, sir.

812
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,840
有谁知道吗？
Does anybody know?

813
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,430
好
Okay.

814
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,510
你爸爸是干什么的，莱尔先生？
What's your father do for a living, Mr. Lyle?

815
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,890
我爸爸在坐牢，先生
My father's in jail, sir.

816
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,550
听到这个我很抱歉，先生
Well, l'm sorry to hear that, sir.

817
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,290
但是你的人生不一定会是这样
But that doesn't have to be your life.

818
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,060
我的看法是：
My point's this:

819
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,600
这个队里有四个比较突出的队员
l have four seniors on this team,

820
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,770
朱尼尔、莱尔、凯尼恩和沃姆
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

821
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,740
我认为这四个人都可以去打大学生篮球赛
All of whom l think can play basketball at the college level.

822
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,310
大学
College.

823
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,280
对你们来说这是可行的选择
That's a viable option for all of you.

824
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,620
但是要获得这样的机会，你们就必须去上课
But you have to perform in the classroom to have that chance.

825
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,350
你们要有先见之明
You have to have a vision.

826
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,480
告诉我，你们对自己怎么看？
Tell me, how do you see yourselves?

827
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,190
东方体育台(州决赛)，宝贝儿
ESPN, baby.

828
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,960
这提醒了我，巴特尔先生
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

829
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,660
盖瑟克先生告诉我，他在课堂里不能经常看到你
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't see you in his classroom very often.

830
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,660
对，不过我和他关系不错
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

831
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,870
盖瑟克先生是个篮球迷
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

832
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,580
好，从现在起，你被停赛了
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

833
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,580
哦，你可以训练，但是不能打比赛
Oh, you can practice, but you can't play

834
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,380
直到盖瑟克先生告诉我你赶上了他的课程为止
until Mr. Gesek tells me you're caught up in his class.

835
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,020
这也是对你们其他人的警告
And that's a shout out to the rest of you.

836
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,620
你们签了合同
You signed a contract.

837
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,520
你们作了保证
You made a commitment.

838
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,920
现在我有你们的课程表，还会从你们的老师那里收到报告
Now, l have your schedules and l'll be getting reports from your teachers.

839
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,330
如果你们不去上课，就不能打比赛
lf you don't perform in the classroom, you will not play.

840
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,930
这算什么？
What's up with that?

841
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,130
坐下，巴特尔先生
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

842
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,540
好吧，那就做五百个俯卧撑
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

843
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,110
这是在放屁！是我们赢了那些比赛，不是你
Man, this is bullshit! We won those games, not you.

844
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,380
那么巴特尔先生要做一千个俯卧撑，克莱德
That's 1 ,000 push-ups for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

845
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,750
你还想要两千个？
You wanna try for 2,000?

846
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:06,140
年轻人，如果你要走出那个门，请考虑一下你的选择
Young man, think about the choice you're making if you walk out that door.

847
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,740
到底线去
To the baseline.

848
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,020
好吧，“拉奎莎”怎样？假如是女孩的话
All right. How about LaQuisha, if it's a girl.

849
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,720
拉奎莎？好啊，穷人区会打来电话，要把他们的名字收回去
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto called and they want they name back.

850
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,030
女孩，拉奎莎？认真点吧
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

851
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,530
你还是给宝宝起名叫“食物券”吧
You might as well call the baby Food Stamp.

852
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,330
你真傻
You're stupid.

853
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:40,070
[Harmony：和谐]
好了，我的想法是叫她哈蒙妮
All right, l was thinking l could call her Harmony.

854
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,210
- 我喜欢哈蒙妮  - 哈蒙妮，哦，挺好的，我喜欢
- l like Harmony.  - Harmony, oh, that's good. l like that.

855
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,680
- 凯尼恩怎么说？ - 算了吧，他想要男孩
- What did Kenyon say?  - Please, he want a boy.

856
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,250
[说曹操曹操到]
- 我猜也是  - 正说迈克尔·乔丹呢
- Figures.  - Speaking of Michael Jordan...

857
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,850
喂，女孩有什么不好？
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

858
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,680
对，小子，男孩长成男人了，男人就得让我们操心
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men, and men ain't worth the trouble.

859
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,260
你们没什么地方要去吗？没事干？
Don't you have someplace to go? Something to do?

860
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,130
看来他是要独占我
Guess he wants me all to himself.

861
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,360
回见
See you later.

862
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,230
别忘了，我还要你的历史笔记
Don't forget, l need your notes for history.

863
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,630
- 好的，我记住了  - 好，回见
- All right, l got you.  - Yeah. See you later.

864
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,770
我买了去跳舞的票子
l bought us tickets to the dance.

865
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,010
为什么你要把宝宝的事告诉这些大嘴娘们？
Why you telling these loudmouth girls about the baby?

866
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,150
现在人人都会知道了
Now everybody's gonna know.

867
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,910
别人总会知道的，凯尼恩
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

868
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,280
- 这又不关别人的事，吉拉  - 为什么你要跟我抢白？
- lt's not people's business, Kyra.  - Why you jumping down my throat?

869
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,920
你是怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

870
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,260
我和教练谈过了，他觉得我可以去打大学篮球赛
Look, me and coach been talking, and he thinks l can play college ball.

871
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,490
好，然后呢？
All right, so?

872
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,890
我怎么可以一边打比赛，一边养孩子？
So how am l gonna do that and raise a baby?

873
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,130
我不知道，我的意思是我没说这不会很难
l don't know. l mean, l'm not saying it won't be hard.

874
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,740
难？已经很难了
Hard? lt's already hard.

875
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,500
孩子还没生出来，可我已经在担心
The kid ain't even here yet and l'm worried

876
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,840
要怎么养活他，拿什么去买这买那
about how l'm gonna feed it, how l'm gonna pay for this and that.

877
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,510
所有东西
Everything.

878
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,870
- 我没准备好  - 那么你要说什么？
- l'm not ready.  - So, what are you saying?

00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,180
你想逃了？你是不是想这么说？
You want out? ls that what you're saying?

880
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,850
说呀，说出来
Go ahead and say it.

881
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,890
听我说，假如我想逃，现在就已经逃了，吉拉
Look, if l wanted to be out, l would've been out by now, Kyra.

That's not it at all. l love you.

00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,390
我要和你在一起
l wanna be with you.

884
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,620
对，只要不麻烦
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

885
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,200
我是在考虑怎么做对我们最好
l'm thinking about what's best for us.

886
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,630
你没有考虑怎么做对我们俩最好
You're not trying to think about what's best for both of us,

887
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,430
你只考虑怎么做对你最好
you're thinking about what's best for you.

888
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,270
你不想让我把宝宝生下来，你想离开里士满
You don't want me to have this baby. You wanna leave Richmond.

889
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,310
你想去打大学篮球赛，所以你猜怎么着？
You wanna go play college ball. So guess what?

890
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:22,410
什么事也不用准备了，行吗？
We ain't got to be ready enough for nothing, all right?

891
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,540
我已经准备好自己一个人来负担一切
l'm ready enough to do what l gotta do all by my damn self.

892
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,720
这个你拿着吧，一个人去跳舞吧
So you can take these and go to the dance yourself.

893
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,980
进度报告？可你是篮球教练啊？
Progress reports? You're the basketball coach.

894
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,680
听我说，夫人，我们已经谈过了，我不明白问题出在什么地方
Look, ma'am, we talked about this. l don't see what the problem is.

895
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,420
你知道什么是API吗，卡特先生？
Do you know what the APl is, Mr. Carter?

896
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,960
不知道
No, l don't.

897
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,830
学业表现指数
The Academic Performance lndex.

898
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,060
他们用一到十的等级来衡量各个学校，十级是最好的
They judge schools on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best.

899
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,700
你知道里士满是在哪一级吗？
Do you have any idea where Richmond falls on that scale?

900
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,170
不，夫人，我不知道
No, ma'am, l have no idea.

901
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,100
我们是一级，卡特先生，而且已经持续了七年
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have been for the last seven years.

902
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,280
州政府根据学校的表现来发奖金
The state rewards schools for their performance.

903
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,840
所以每年我付给教职员的钱都比较少
So every year l have less money to pay faculty and staff.

904
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,980
- 听我说，夫人…  - 可以问一下你想要什么吗？
- Look, ma'am...  - Can l ask what it is you want?

905
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,180
- 我想让孩子们上大学  - 大学？
- l want my boys to go to college.  - College?

906
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,050
卡特先生，里士满只让百分之五十的学生毕业
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates 50 percent of its students,

907
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,550
而且女孩的毕业率比较高
the higher percentage being girls.

908
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,620
根据我多年的教学经验，你队里十五个球员
Now, in my very educated opinion, you have 1 5 players on your team,

909
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,560
能有五个毕业就不错了
you'll be lucky to graduate five of them.

910
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,560
对不起，夫人，可我不同意你的意见
l'm sorry, ma'am, but l don't agree with you.

911
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,560
这些孩子签了合同，如果你看一下的话，说不定…
Look, these boys signed contracts. Maybe if you'd read one of them...

912
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,240
你的工作是赢得篮球赛，卡特先生
Your job is to win basketball games, Mr. Carter.

913
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,070
- 我建议你专心干你的工作  - 你的工作是教育这些孩子
- l suggest you start doing your job.  - And your job is to educate these kids.

914
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,870
我也建议你专心干你的工作
l suggest you start doing yours.

915
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,590
好…
Well...

916
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,150
…又是不错的一周
...we had another good week.

917
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,700
对，生意非常好，肯尼
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

918
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:50,770
可都是我自己干的，你从不到这里来
But l'm on my own. You're never here.

919
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,670
- 我快累死了  - 听我说，我很感激你做的一切
- lt gets crazy.  - Look, l appreciate everything you do.

920
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,970
我向你保证…我们已经关门了
And l promise you... We're closed.

921
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,730
…赛季一结束，我就来这里帮你
...as soon as the season is over, l will be here for you.

922
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,380
卡特先生？
Mr. Carter?

923
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,170
- 我是…  - 朱尼尔·巴特尔的妈妈
- l'm...  - Junior Battle's mother.

924
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,940
对，夫人，我记得你
Yes, ma'am, l remember you.

925
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,810
维拉，维拉·巴特尔
Willa. Willa Battle.

926
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,380
要我帮什么忙，夫人？
How may l help you, ma'am?

927
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,990
卡特先生，我今天接到一个电话
Mr. Carter, l got a phone call today

928
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,890
是萨克拉门托一个大学的教练打来的
from a coach at a junior college in Sacramento.

929
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,120
这个星期五他们想看朱尼尔打比赛
Now, they wanna see Junior play this Friday.

930
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,660
哦，那可太好了，夫人，不过朱尼尔违反了一些规定…
Well, that's great, ma'am, but Junior broke some rules...

931
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,390
我对规定很赞成
And l agree with them.

932
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,160
我来这里不是要和你争论那些规定
l'm not here to argue with your rules.

933
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,960
不是的
l'm not.

934
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,240
差不多两年前
Almost two years ago now,

935
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:34,740
朱尼尔的哥哥安东…
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

936
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:40,750
…被杀了，我和朱尼尔一直难过到现在
...killed, and it's been confusing and hard for me and for Junior.

937
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,120
你一旦失去一个儿子以后…
After you lose a son...

938
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:50,250
…每当电话铃响，你的心跳都会停止
...every time the phone rings, your heart stops.

939
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,760
我不是来要求特别照顾的
Now, l'm not asking for special attention.

940
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,560
我也同意，他需要认真学习
l agree he needs to get straight with his classes.

941
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,800
不过我儿子还从来没有想过上大学的念头
But the idea of junior college had never even occurred to my son.

942
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,880
我也可以搬到大力神中学的街区，他可以在那里打球
Now, l could move to the Hercules school district, and he could play there.

943
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,810
- 不过搬家不能解决…  - 可是我希望他为你打球
- But moving is not gonna solve...  - But l want him to play for you.

944
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,820
听我说，我不会站在这里说
Look, l'm not gonna stand here

945
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,550
我知道失去一个儿子是什么感觉，因为我没有碰到这种事
and say l know how it feels to lose a son, because l don't.

946
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,620
我也非常感谢你对我的信任
And l do appreciate you putting your trust in me.

947
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,630
但是我要听听朱尼尔怎么说
But l need to hear that from Junior.

948
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,760
他在车里
He in the car.

949
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,270
朱尼尔！
Junior!

950
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,640
去吧
Go on.

951
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,320
我对训练时说的话和做的事感到很抱歉
l'm sorry for what l said and did at practice,

952
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,620
我保证会赶上我的课，先生
and l promise to get caught up with my classes, sir.

953
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,130
看着我的眼睛，先生
Look me in the eye, sir.

954
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,770
我的内心告诉我，如果我让你回来
Everything inside me tells me if l take you back,

955
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,540
就犯了一个错误，而你会愚弄我
l'd be making a mistake and you'll make a fool of me.

956
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,650
不会，先生
No, sir.

957
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,150
你要给我做一千个俯卧撑
You owe me 1 ,000 push-ups

958
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,020
和一千次自杀才能上场
and 1 ,000 suicides before you can play.

959
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,860
明天训练的时候再见
l'll see you at practice tomorrow.

960
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,930
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

961
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,770
你要全部做完
And you gonna do every last one of them.

962
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,030
放弃篮球，好像房租是你付的一样
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

963
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,640
我真不知道你以为自己是谁
l don't know who you think you are.

964
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,210
下次你要作主张，最好先问过我
The next time you make a decision, you better ask me first.

965
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,880
朱尼尔，今晚你发挥不错
Yo, Junior, you did your thing tonight, man.

966
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,710
- 你看得很准啊  - 对，投得好，朱尼尔
- Good looking out, yo.  - Yeah, good shot, Junior.

967
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,520
- 对，毫无疑问  - 先生们，听好
- Yeah, no doubt.  - Gentlemen, listen up.

968
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:04,190
我刚接到湾丘假日锦标赛的主管的电话
l just received a call from the director of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

969
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,730
你们被邀请了
You have been invited.

970
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,420
- 好啊！ - 好啊，宝贝儿！
- Yeah!  - Yeah, baby!

971
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,300
我还有一条好消息
Now, l have more good news.

972
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,600
今天我和加里森校长谈过了
l spoke to Principal Garrison today.

973
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,680
她告诉我你们的老师会在假期结束前
She informs me that your teachers will have your academic-progress reports

974
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,780
准备好你们的学习进度报告
prepared by the end of holiday break.

975
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,470
先生，我们的成绩刚刚好
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

976
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,550
不光我们的成绩没问题，教练
Yo, not only are our grades all right, coach,

977
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,410
- 我们还保持了不败，伙计  - 对！
- but we undefeated, homeboy.  - Yeah!

978
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:34,850
我们保持不败，我们保持不败
We undefeated We undefeated

979
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,290
我们保持不败，我们保持不败
We undefeated We undefeated

980
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,300
我们保持不败，我们保持不败
We undefeated We undefeated

981
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,600
欢迎各位来参加里士满高中冬季舞会！
Big ups to everybody who came out to the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

982
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,360
开始吧！
Get down!

983
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,760
向里士满的新大王致敬吧！
So give it up for the new kings of Richmond, y'all!

984
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:17,830
对！致敬，宝贝儿！
Yeah! Give it up, baby!

985
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,970
我们十二胜零负，各位，我只想说
Yo, we 1 2-0, y'all, and l just wanna say

986
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,830
我想看看那锦标赛上的所有可人儿
l wanna see all the beautiful people up at that tournament.

987
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,570
你知道！
You know!

988
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,540
你们都想看看里士满油井队进城时
Y'all gonna wanna see the look on the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

989
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,470
那些体面的阔学生脸上的表情
when the Richmond Oilers roll into town.

990
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,910
Holla！
Holla!

991
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,630
吉拉，你在想什么？你不能喝酒！
Kyra, what are you thinking? You can't drink!

992
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,630
- 你怀孕了，姑娘  - 住手
- You're pregnant, girl.  - Stop.

993
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,060
这是苏打水，行了吧？
lt's soda, all right?

994
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,070
为什么你不回楼下去
So why don't you just go back downstairs

995
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,140
找你的小妞操呢
and find one of your little girlies to freak with.

996
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,570
根本不是那么一回事，只不过有个女孩子在我身边跳舞
lt ain't even like that. Some girl just danced up on me.

997
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,440
- 不骗你  - 随你怎么说
- That ain't shit.  - Whatever.

998
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,540
你不应该来这儿，假如你是认真的
You shouldn't be here. lf you're serious about this,

999
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,540
你就应该仔细想想，因为要不是…
you need to check this bullshit. Because if not...

1000
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,980
要不是什么，凯尼恩？你想拉着我的手去做流产？
lf not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold my hand through an abortion?

1001
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,150
- 你就是想这样吧？ - 我不知道我想怎样
- ls that what you want?  - l don't know what l want.

1002
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,880
你这么坚决想要这孩子
You so damn sure you wanna have this baby,

1003
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,580
为什么不告诉我将来会怎样
why don't you tell me how it's gonna be.

1004
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,490
一切都会很好，对吗？
Everything's great, right?

1005
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,320
你表姐十九岁已经有了两个孩子，吉拉
Your cousin is 1 9 with two kids already, Kyra.

1006
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,890
那样很好吗？
lt's great?

1007
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,960
我们一起睡的时候倒是很好
lt was great when we was getting down.

1008
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,860
你那时候根本没好好想过
You ain't having no second thoughts about that.

1009
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,370
你爱我，结果就这样了

- That's what l'm talking about.  - l know.

1137
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:03,180
- 你现在没有男朋友吧？ - 也许
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?  - Maybe.

1138
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,590
呦！
Yo!

1139
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,130
你在找你的队员吧？
You looking for your team?

1140
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,030
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

1141
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,390
哦，宝贝儿，真家伙，你明白我说什么吗？
Oh, baby. Hard biz. Know what l'm saying?

1142
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,930
这就我想要的，我真爽死了，你能感受到吗？莱尔
This is my style right here. l'm amazing. Feel me, Lyle?

1143
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,870
嘿，呦，莱尔，给我瓶橙汁
Hey, yo, Lyle. Let me get a coochie juice.

1144
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,440
这就来，兄弟，这就来
l got you, dog. l got you.

1145
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,230
- 呦，沃姆！ - 怎么样，兄弟
- Yo, Worm!  - What up, dog?

1146
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,070
- 戴米恩  - 什么事
- Damien!  - Yeah?

1147
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,770
[以为自己在打篮球]
没人盯我！
l'm open!

1148
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,840
戴米恩！
Damien!

1149
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:49,020
- 戴米恩，你喝多了吧？ - 没有，我从不喝酒
- Damien, are you drunk?  - No. l don't drink.

1150
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,090
- 不好意思  - 没事儿
- Sorry about the thing.  - lt's okay.

1151
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,760
- 我看见你了  - 我也能看见你
- l see you!  - l see you too.

1152
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,590
- 我看见她了  - 我们为什么不去游泳
- l see her!  - Why don't we go swimming.

1153
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,660
- 我们去游泳？ - 对啊
- We're going swimming?  - Yeah.

1154
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,390
嘿，我要去游泳！
Hey, l'm going swimming!

1155
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,560
我要去游泳！
l'm going swimming!

1156
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,260
你将会和全场最佳球员一起游
You're going swimming with the MVP!

1157
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,670
全场最佳球员！
MVP!

1158
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,980
水一定很冷吧，不要下去了
This water's probably cold as hell, shorty. l don't know.

1159
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,530
我也不太喜欢游泳
And swimming ain't my cup of tea, baby. Know what l'm saying?

1160
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:31,630
[约摄氏32度]
水是加热的，大概有华氏九十度
Heated. Probably 90 degrees.

1161
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:34,490
- 我们没有带游泳时穿的衣服  - 是啊
- We don't have bathing suits.  - Right.

1162
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,690
我们也没有
Neither do we.

1163
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,870
原来如此
Oh, so it's like that?

1164
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,770
亮出来看看呐
Show me the money, then, know what l'm saying?

1165
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,710
- 操  - 既然如此
- Damn!  - Since it's like that.

1166
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:55,290
哦，操，不错，不错
Oh, damn. Yeah, that's nice.

1167
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,660
- 操  - 身材真不错
- Damn!  - You are looking right.

1168
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,830
我喜欢
l like that.

1169
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,760
你们下来吗？
You guys coming?

1170
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,260
马上就下来
We're getting in there.

1171
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,860
[可能因为链子是铜的]
我要把链子拿下来，不然就绿了
l gotta take my chain off so it don't turn green.

1172
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,770
难以置信
Oh, man, l can't believe this.

1173
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,470
天堂啊！
Heaven!

1174
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,230
打扰一下
Excuse me.

1175
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:43,830
- 你是什么人？ - 我叫肯·卡特
- Can l help you?  - l'm Ken Carter,

1176
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,830
里士满中学篮球队的教练
coach of the Richmond High basketball team.

1177
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,800
里士满？
Richmond?

1178
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:51,100
- 你迷路了吧？ - 我在找我儿子
- You're a little lost, aren't you?  - Well, l'm looking for my son.

1179
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:55,040
有个的士司机说我的队员来了这里开派队
The cab driver told me he dropped the team off here for a party.

1180
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,770
不好意思
Excuse me.

1181
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,580
哦，老天，这是…？
Oh, my God, is that...?

1182
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,350
哦，老天爷，是苏珍的老爸
Oh, my God, it's Susan's dad.

1183
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,550
你看到你儿子了吗？
You see your son?

1184
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,090
是的，先生，我看到了
Yes, sir, l do.

1185
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,600
戴米恩·卡特
Damien Carter.

1186
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,670
你给我滚出来
Get your ass out of that pool.

1187
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,850
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

1188
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,570
里士满中学篮球队队员，跟我走！
Richmond High players, let's go!

1189
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,010
- 教练！ - 嘿，沃姆，你去哪儿了？
- Coach!  - Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1190
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,780
沃姆？
Worm?

1191
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,750
你好啊，教练
What up, coach?

1192
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,980
我想给你介绍个人
l got somebody l want you to meet.

1193
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:16,890
我才认识的，非常正点
Now, l just met her, but she is fine as hell.

1194
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,900
- 她叫…  - 苏珍
- Her name is...  - Susan!

1195
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,330
- 苏珍，没错  - 哦，操
- Susan. He right!  - Oh, shit.

1196
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,330
我的女儿，苏珍
My daughter, Susan.

1197
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:30,280
你们一定不会喜欢星期一的训练
You are not going to like what happens in practice on Monday.

1198
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,710
你们背着我逃了出去
You think you've run for me before?

1199
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:37,440
我可是要和你们一起庆祝一下，你们这帮鬼鬼祟祟的…
l come to your rooms to celebrate with you, and you sneak...

1200
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:43,510
害的我上郊区兜了一圈
l end up taking a road trip to the suburbs,

1201
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,280
竟然找到我的喝醉的中锋
where l find my drunk-ass point guard

1202
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:48,790
在老爸的乖女儿身上(做爱)
on top of Daddy's little princess!

1203
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,860
事实上，我在下面，教练，她在上面
Actually, l was on the bottom, coach. She was on the top.

1204
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:55,530
沃姆，你还想留在队里吗？
Worm, do you wanna be on this team?

1205
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,360
我随时可以踢你出队
Because you're about six words from getting kicked off

1206
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:01,470
还可以把你一脚从车上踢出去
and kicked off the goddamn bus!

1207
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,940
克鲁兹，张开眼
Cruz, open your eyes!

1208
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:06,340
一帮大明星！
Ghetto hoop stars!

1209
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:10,270
到处签字，泡妞
Signing autographs and humping the honeys!

1210
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:13,580
我要给你们点颜色看看
Well, l'm gonna show you what humping is.

1211
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:17,720
教练，我们不是赢了吗？
Coach, we won the tournament.

1212
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,260
战无不胜
We undefeated.

1213
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,550
这不就是你想要的吗？
l mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1214
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,090
赢家？
Winners?

1215
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,930
天呐
Oh, no.

1216
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:42,110
天呐，天呐
Oh, no, no, no.

1217
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:44,870
我的天啊
Oh, no!

1218
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,740
老天爷…！
God...!

1219
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,290
你们太棒了！
You guys are awesome!

1220
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,240
怎么了，克鲁兹？
What's up, Cruz?

1221
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,640
不知道
l don't know.

1222
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:22,840
教练大概是给我们放天假吧
Coach giving us a day off, l guess.

1223
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,200
[训练取消，到图书馆集合]

1224
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,210
我连图书馆在哪都不知道
Yo, l don't even know where the library's even at.

1225
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:30,520
- 我就知道你不知道  - 图书馆在哪？
- l bet you don't.  - "Library's at"?

1226
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,950
他不知道图书馆在哪
He don't know where the library's at.

1227
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,570
肃静
Quiet.

1228
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,670
肃静！
Quiet!

1229
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:57,210
先生们，我这只手上的是合同
Gentlemen, in this hand, l hold contracts

1230
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,820
你们和我在上面都签过字了
signed by me and signed by you.

1231
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:04,680
我的另外一只手里的是老师们给你们做的学习进程报告
ln this hand, l hold academic-progress reports prepared by your teachers.

1232
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,890
你们当中有六人至少一科不及格
We have six players failing at least one class,

1233
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:12,190
八人逃课而不过关
eight players getting incompletes based on attendance.

1234
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,600
先生们，你们失败了
Gentlemen, you have failed to up...

1235
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,830
不对，对不起
No, l'm sorry.

1236
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,530
是“我们”失败了
We have failed.

1237
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,810
我们是输给了我们自己的
We have failed each other.

1238
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,900
你们当中有人达到标准
Now, there are some of you who have upheld this contract.

1239
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:29,510
但是我们大家是一个队
But know that we are a team.

1240
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,620
除非我们当中每人都达标
And until we all meet the terms of this contract,

1241
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,550
不然的话，体育馆就会一直被锁着
the gym will remain locked.

1242
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,950
- 还要锁？ - 什么啊？
- Locked?  - What?

1243
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,350
- 你为什么要锁？ - 就今天吗？
- What you mean, locked?  - What, like for the day?

1244
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,460
- 你说一定只是今天吧  - 汤姆森先生
- He must mean for the day.  - Mr. Thompson,

1245
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:43,890
盖瑟克先生和舍曼女士会慷慨地奉献时间为你们补课
Mr. Gesek and Miss Sherman have generously volunteered their time

1246
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,590
让我们最终赢得胜利
to help us reach our goals.

1247
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,430
但是，教练，我得了三点三分
But, coach, l have a 3.3.

1248
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,000
好样的，先生
That's good, sir.

1249
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,260
你个人成绩能顶全队的吗？
Do you score all the points for the team too?

1250
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:57,270
我们是里士满油井队
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1251
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,770
你知道油井队员代表什么吗？
Do you know what Oilers stands for?

1252
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,050
先生
Sir?

1253
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,650
你不能就这样一走了之
Know that you're not just walking out on me.

1254
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,880
你这样对其他队友是不负责任的
You're walking out on them.

1255
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,590
我当初不得不求你
l had to beg you.

1256
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,990
跑我也跑了
And then l ran all those sprints.

1257
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:21,250
俯卧撑也做了
l did all that shit.

1258
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:25,600
我拚了命，才回到队里
l killed myself for you, sir, to get back on the team.

1259
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,840
原来这都是扯蛋
This is bullshit.

1260
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:56,730
你把体育馆锁上，硬要他们到图书馆见你？
You put a lock on the gym and forced them to meet you in the library?

1261
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,460
- 你疯了吗？ - 加里森女士
- Are you crazy?  - Miss Garrison.

1262
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,770
我很惊讶，你居然知道我的办公室在哪
l'm surprised you know where my office is.

1263
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:02,530
把体育馆上的锁开了
Take the lock off that gym.

1264
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,210
我电话一直就没断过
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1265
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,000
也许打电话的人
Maybe someone on the other end of that phone

1266
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,910
有解决办法
has a solution to our problem.

1267
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,210
你的动机是好的，卡特先生，但你的方法极端了点儿
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter, but your methods are a bit extreme.

1268
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,350
当初是你亲口说的
You painted an extreme picture.

1269
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:16,390
没有人认为他们能毕业，没有人认为他们能上大学
No one expects them to graduate, no one expects them to go to college.

1270
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:19,350
你应此就把篮球从他们生活中拿走，篮球可是他们
So you take away basketball, the one area of their lives

1271
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,460
- 是的，夫人  - 生活中唯一有点成就的方面
- where they have some success?  - Yes, ma'am.

1272
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,290
然后让他们去读书
And you challenge them academically?

1273
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,230
- 是的，夫人  - 但是如果他们失败了呢？
- Yes, ma'am.  - And what if they fail?

1274
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,530
那我们都失败了
Then we've failed.

1275
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,360
事实上，卡特先生，你我都知道
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter, both you and l know

1276
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,800
这个篮球赛季对于这里有些孩子来说
that for some of these kids, this basketball season

1277
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:36,600
很可能是他们这辈子中最灿烂日子
will be the highlight of their lives.

1278
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:41,170
这能到不就是矛盾的根源吗？不是吗？
Well, l think that's the problem. Don't you?

1279
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,500
[今晚比赛取消]

1280
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,510
- 早上好，卡特教练  - 早上好
- Good morning, Coach Carter.  - Good morning.

1281
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,470
[意指自找的麻烦]
你打开的是一个潘多拉盒子啊
Quite the Pandora's box you've opened.

1282
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,110
噢，都是我的错？
Oh, l get all the blame now?

1283
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:15,180
荣誉都算你头上好了
Let's just say l'm happy to give you all the credit.

1284
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:18,610
所有的新闻记者都来了
l've got every news reporter in town waiting to speak to you.

1285
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,510
记者招待会已经在体育馆前准备好了
Got a press conference set up around the front of the gymnasium.

1286
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,980
卡特教练把这次禁球事件越搞越火
Coach Carter has taken the lockout to the next level

1287
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,920
已经取消了今晚的比赛
by canceling last night's game.

1288
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:29,690
里士满弃权，这是他们这个赛季的第一场败球
Richmond forfeited the game, making it their first loss of the season.

1289
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,690
目前为止，体育馆还是锁着
And for now, the lock remains on the gym.

1290
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,660
他来了，他来了
Here he comes. Here he comes now.

1291
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:38,030
卡特教练，教练，我能问你一个问题吗？
Coach Carter! Coach! Can l get a question?

1292
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,660
女士们，先生们，早上好，让大家久等了
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. l'd like to thank you for your patience.

1293
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,640
此时此刻，我给大家介绍卡特教练
At this time, l'd like to introduce Coach Ken Carter.

1294
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,110
你们有问题可以直接问他
You may direct your questions to him.

1295
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:51,910
卡特先生，你连过关的学生也不让打球，这公平吗？
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players whose grades qualify them to play?

1296
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,810
先生，篮球是团队运动
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1297
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,350
我们场上场下都互相支持
We support each other on and off the court.

1298
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,890
谁现在还以为卡特教练在吓唬我们呢？
Anybody still think coach bluffing now?

1299
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,750
我很想跑进那堆记者里
l feel like running right up in the middle of all those reporters

1300
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,400
告诉他们这都是放屁的
and telling them l think this is bullshit, son.

1301
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,960
也许你当初就该去上课，莱尔
Maybe you should've gone to class, Lyle.

1302
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,930
也许你该舔我屁眼，小子，我成绩没问题，老兄
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog. My grades are fine, homeboy.

1303
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:13,110
- 朱尼尔才应被禁球  - 也许朱尼尔应该痛扁你
- lt's Junior they should've locked out.  - Maybe Junior will kick your ass out.

1304
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:16,640
- 那你能一个字一个字拚出来吗？ - 别闹，别闹，真他妈的
- Why don't you try spelling it, then.  - Chill, chill, chill, man. Damn.

1305
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,570
- 朱尼尔，如果你需要，我来给你补课  - 别来，我不需要
- Junior, if you need help, l'll tutor you.  - Man, l don't need no help.

1306
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:21,440
他也不是无中生有
Well, he ain't lock us out for no reason.

1307
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:25,080
我们最近闹的太厉害了
We been tripping lately, man. All y'all know it.

1308
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:27,650
你认为整个社区会对此事怎么反应呢？
How do you think the community's gonna react to this lockout?

1309
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,950
我还不清楚，我希望他们能支持这些年轻人
l'm not really sure. l hope they'll support these young men.

1310
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,150
什么事儿？
What, man?

1311
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,590
没事儿，挺有意思的，老兄，是朱尼尔
No, man, it's just funny, dog, because, Junior, man,

1312
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,990
他自然科学不及格，光我们知道就够惨了
you thought it was bad all us knew your dumb ass was failing science.

1313
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,690
现在全世界都要知道了
Now the whole world about to know your dumb ass failing science.

1314
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,630
- 你  - 嗨
- Man.  - Hey, man.

1315
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:49,500
[甫黎莽特队篮球队]
你这个星期六要迎对甫黎莽特队，是你们目前最重要的比赛
And you have Fremont this Saturday, the biggest game on your schedule.

1316
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:53,540
如果你弃权，里士满社区一定会造反的
Now, Richmond is gonna riot if you forfeit that game.

1317
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,310
离星期六还有一段时间
Saturday is a long way off.

1318
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,450
到时再说，谢谢大家光临
We'll see what happens. Thank you all for coming.

1319
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:00,180
我很忙，我还有活儿要干
That's all the time l have right now. l have to get back to work.

1320
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,290
教练，你和他们的家长谈过吗？
Coach, have you talked to any of the parents?

1321
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,950
女士们，先生们，谢谢大家光临
Thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen.

1322
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,820
我要再次提醒大家，考虑到学生还在上课
l'd like to remind you that classes are in session,

1323
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,390
请大家离开校园时保持安静
so as you leave campus, please do so quietly.

1324
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,230
我一定要小心点
l ain't turning the cheek.

1325
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:16,830
如果他到我地盘来，我说真的，我和他拚
He come up in my 'hood, l'm serious, it's on.

1326
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,270
- 年轻的先生们  - 一直都这样儿
- Young sirs.  - lt's always been like that.

1327
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:21,440
今天不容易
lt's been a long day.

1328
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,630
记者，传媒到处都是
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1329
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,940
现在关上门，你们想说的就说吧
Let's take this time to say whatever it is we want while the doors are closed.

1330
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:32,740
到你们说的时候了，就谈我们自己的事儿
You have the floor. This is about us.

1331
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:36,290
扯蛋，这不是我们的事儿，都是你卡特教练的事儿
Man, this shit ain't about us. This is all about Coach Carter.

1332
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:38,220
我们不是一个篮球队吗？
We're the basketball team.

1333
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:41,880
那怎么就你一个人上电视，出风头
All l see is you on TV, getting famous, eating that shit up.

1334
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,390
- 你就看见这个了吗？ - 就看见这个了
- ls that all you see?  - lt's all l see.

1335
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,360
他没说错
You ain't lying.

1336
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,490
那好，让我告诉你我都看见什么了
Well, let me tell you what l see.

1337
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:54,170
我看见的是一个不给你们出路的教育系统
l see a system that's designed for you to fail.

1338
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:57,200
我知道你们相信数字，我就给你们些数字
Now, l know you all like stats, so let me give you some.

1339
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:01,280
里士满高中毕业率是百分之五十
Richmond High only graduates 50 percent of its students.

1340
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:06,650
毕业生其中只有百分之六能上大学
And of those that do graduate, only 6 percent go to college.

1341
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:11,810
也就是说，每次我走进体育馆看到你们时
Which tells me, when l walk down the halls and l look in your classrooms,

1342
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:16,290
其中只有一个人能上大学
maybe only one student is going to go to college.

1343
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,360
[第三语气]
操他妈的，卡特教练，如果我不能上大学，那我怎么办？
"Well, damn, Coach Carter, if l ain't going to college, where l'm gonna go?"

1344
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,690
这个问题问得好
Now, that's a great question.

1345
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:28,360
对于在美国的黑人来说，答案就
And the answer for young African-American men in here is this:

1346
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:30,480
很可能是坐牢
probably to prison.

1347
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,810
我们这个社区，十八到二十四岁男性黑人
ln this county, 33 percent of black males

1348
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:39,450
百分之三十三的都会坐牢
between 1 8 and 24 get arrested.

1349
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,380
现在看看你左边的那个人
So look at the guy on your left.

1350
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:45,690
再看看你右边的那个人
Now look at the guy on your right.

1351
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:49,220
你们其中有一个就会坐牢
One of you is going to get arrested.

1352
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,590
在里士满长大的
Growing up here in Richmond,

1353
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:56,430
你坐牢的几率要比你上大学高出百分之八十
you're 80 percent more likely to go to prison than college.

1354
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,570
这就你们要面对的
Those are the numbers.

1355
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,640
这就事实
Those are some stats for your ass.

1356
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:05,740
你们回家后…
Now, l want you to go home...

1357
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,370
…仔细想一想你的将来…
...and look at your lives tonight...

1358
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,420
…看看你们父母的现状…
...and look at your parents' lives...

1359
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:14,950
…扪心自问“我想要个什么样的将来”？
...and ask yourself, "Do l want better?"

1360
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:17,850
如果答案是对
lf the answer is yes,

1361
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:20,250
明天我们这里见
l'll see you here tomorrow.

1362
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:22,960
我向你保证…
And l promise you...

1363
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:27,220
…我会尽我全力
...l will do everything in my power

1364
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:29,160
让你们上大学
to get you to college

1365
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,600
让你们有个美好的未来
and to a better life.

1366
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,960
我不懂了，这不是个字母吗？怎么是个数呢？
l don't understand this. lt's a letter, how can it be a number?

1367
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,860
方程式佩平的怎么样了
How are balancing those equations coming?

1368
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:07,040
- 真受不了了  - 别走，来来
- l can't do this.  - Hold on. Come on, son.

1369
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,400
别放弃呀
Don't give up yet, son.

1370
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:11,410
加利福尼亚州的一个故事轰动全国
Here's a story out of California that's getting national attention.

1371
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:14,440
里士满高中篮球队的全体成员
The entire boys' basketball team at Richmond High School

1372
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:15,980
都被禁赛
has been benched.

1373
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:18,710
排名很高的油井队此赛季战无不胜
The highly ranked Oilers have a perfect season on the court,

1374
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,320
但有些队员课堂上有困难
but some players were in big trouble academically.

1375
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,420
卡特教练史无前例的取消了训练
And in an unprecedented move, Coach Ken Carter canceled practice,

1376
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:29,060
锁上了体育馆，把队员们送到了图书馆
locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library.

1377
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,420
在这个赛季开始时
Now, at the start of the season,

1378
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:33,220
我知道你让所有的队员签了一份合同之后
l understand you made all of your players sign a contract

1379
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,760
才让他们入队
before they could join the team.

1380
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:37,030
合同里都有什么条款呢？
What exactly were the conditions of that contract?

1381
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,730
合同指明队员必须
The contract states that the players must maintain

1382
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,530
每门功课平均达到二点三分
a 2.3 grade point average

1383
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:44,110
所有队员要上所有的课
and that the players must attend all their classes

1384
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:46,640
还要坐在前排上课
and sit in the front row of those classes.

1385
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,940
卡特教练，根据您的队的赢取的纪录来看
Well, Coach Carter, it's an unusual strategy, and a risky one

1386
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:52,010
这是一个很特殊的训练方法，也很冒险的方法
in a sense, in light of your team's winning record,

1387
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,350
但是一定有好多人会高兴的获知
but l think there's gonna be a lot of people out there pleased to learn

1388
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,180
还有些人注重学生运动员肢体和是思维的全面发展
that at least somebody still cares about the concept of a student athlete.

1389
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:01,160
很荣幸您今天能来
Thanks a lot for joining us today.

1390
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:08,630
打扰一下
l'm sorry to disturb you.

- Come on.  - l just wanna be on the team.

1516
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:14,340
进来，进来
Come on. Come on.

1517
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:17,220
赴汤蹈火也行
Whatever you want me to do,

1518
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:19,950
我一定会做的
l'll do it, okay?

1519
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,000
州里对于球员要求的标准是
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA

1520
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,860
平均分达到两分
for participation in extracurricular activities.

1521
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:31,130
- 是的，夫人  - 你的合同上却规定
- Yes, ma'am.  - And according to your contract,

1522
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,570
队员必须平均分达到二点三分？
the players are agreeing to maintain a 2.3?

1523
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:35,710
包括其他的，没错
That, among other things. Yes, ma'am.

1524
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:38,240
- 其他的什么？ - 必须上所有的课
- Other things like...?  - Attending all classes,

1525
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,970
必须坐班里前排
sitting in the front row of those classes,

1526
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,870
在比赛的当天打领带
and wearing a tie on game day.

1527
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,740
明白了，卡特先生
l see. Mr. Carter,

1528
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:47,710
禁球包括训练和比赛？
does the lockout include practices and games?

1529
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,010
你禁球要禁多久呢？
And do you have a set period of time?

1530
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,090
禁球就是什么球都不打
There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1531
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,330
请肃静，请肃静
Please. Quiet, please.

1532
01:39:57,730 --> 01:39:59,820
包括训练和比赛
That includes practices and games,

1533
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:02,300
直到我们整个队伍达到要求的平均分
until we as a team reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1534
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,630
请肃静
Please, quiet.

1535
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,300
请肃静
Please, quiet.

1536
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:09,270
肃静
Quiet.

1537
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,170
谢谢你，卡特先生
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1538
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:15,370
时间紧迫，接下来我们听听大家的意见
ln the interest of time, l'd like to open this board meeting up for comments.

1539
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:18,070
作为一个老师，当一个教练让我
As a teacher, l was offended when asked by a coach

1540
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:20,310
出学生课程报告时，我很不满意
to provide progress reports.

1541
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,920
我的合同里又没有这一条
Nowhere in my contract does it say that l have to do so.

1542
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,720
这下子，我的活儿就多了
lt creates more work.

1543
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,190
禁球还给我们带来了负面的媒体影响
This lockout has brought negative media attention

1544
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:31,160
社会会质问我们老师的能力
that questions our abilities as educators.

1545
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:35,230
停止这次疯狂事件，取消禁球
End this madness. End this lockout.

1546
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,270
我是杰森·莱尔的叔叔
l'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1547
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:40,670
这孩子就为篮球而活着
That boy lives to play ball.

1548
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,900
他现在天天都来上学
Comes to school every day now.

1549
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:45,470
如果你不让他打篮球了
You take away basketball,

1550
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:48,110
谁知道他能做出什么坏事儿
God knows what he'd be into.

1551
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:52,440
他昨天取消了和甫黎莽特队的比赛
Yesterday, he canceled the Fremont game.

1552
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:54,980
这本来是本赛季最大的比赛
Now, that's the biggest game of the year.

1553
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:57,120
大学里也会派人来看我儿子打球
l have scouts coming to watch my boy play.

1554
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,490
- 我们家也是  - 他们的成绩是十六胜无负
- Me too.  - These boys are 1 6-0.

1555
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:03,860
全学校，乃至全社区都在支持这支篮球队
This whole school, this whole community, is behind this team.

1556
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,730
大家每场球必看
Everybody goes to every game.

1557
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:12,340
篮球是那帮孩子生命中仅有的
Basketball is the only thing that these boys have got.

1558
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,700
我们能让卡特就这样把他们毁了吗？
Are we gonna let Carter come in here and take that away from them?

1559
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,500
- 不能  - 没门儿
- No!  - l don't think so.

1560
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:19,910
不可能的
Not gonna happen.

1561
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:30,020
- 我有个提议  - 你说，沃尔特先生
- l'd like to make a motion.  - Yes, Mr. Walters?

1562
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:34,690
我提议把卡特先生革除篮球教练一职
l move that we remove Mr. Carter as head basketball coach.

1563
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:40,990
肃静，肃静
Order, please. Order.

1564
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,790
委员会没有权力
This board does not have the authority

1565
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,060
去开除员工
to terminate employment of a staff position.

1566
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:49,600
那我提议取消禁球，让他们打球
Then l move we end the lockout and let the kids play.

1567
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,440
我也同意
l second the motion.

1568
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:54,010
- 那好  - 我来说一句
- Okay.  - lf l may?

1569
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:55,540
好的，卡特先生
Yes, Mr. Carter.

1570
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:57,770
你们需要考虑你们这样做
You really need to consider the message

1571
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,610
会给那些孩子们灌输一种什么样的信息
that you're sending these boys.

1572
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:04,080
这也是我们社会对职业运动员灌输的信息
lt's the same message that we as a culture send to our pro athletes,

1573
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:06,850
[指辛普森杀妻案之类的]
就是他们可以不守纪律，高于法律
which is that they are above the law.

1574
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:10,660
我所要告诉这些孩子们的是遵守纪律才能有所作为
Now, l'm trying to teach these boys the discipline that will inform their lives

1575
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:12,520
将来才会有更多的谋生机会
and give them choices.

1576
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:17,170
如果你们对十五到十七岁的孩子们说
lf you endorse the fact that 1 5-, 1 6- and 1 7-year-olds

1577
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:20,900
你们可以不用遵守纪律，可以违反合同
don't have to honor the simple rules of a basketball contract,

1578
01:42:21,110 --> 01:42:24,200
那你们说他们还需要多久就会犯法呢？
how long do you think it'll be before they're out there breaking laws?

1579
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,410
三十年前，我代表里士满打过篮球
Now, l played basketball at Richmond 30 years ago.

1580
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:30,950
那个时候就是这样儿
lt was the same thing then.

1581
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:33,520
我的队友有些最后坐牢
Some of my teammates ended up in prison.

1582
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,980
[被打死的]
有些死了
Some of them ended up dead.

1583
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:39,120
我之所以当了这个教练，我就是想改革
l took this job because l wanted to effect change

1584
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,790
为了一队出色的小伙子而改革
in a special group of young men,

1585
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:44,930
我的教法是我认为唯一有效的教法
and this is the only way l know how to do that.

1586
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:48,390
如果你们今天要以投票来取消禁球
lf you vote to end the lockout,

1587
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,660
你们也不用开除我了，我不干了
you won't have to terminate me. l'll quit.

1588
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:53,270
好
Good.

1589
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,180
谢谢你，卡特先生
Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1590
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,980
这个委员会共有五名委员
The board now recognizes five voting members.

1591
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:10,020
这次会议，我们也会接受加里森校长的投票
ln this instance, we will be accepting the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1592
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:14,190
现在，我让这些委员投票决定
Now, l put to those members the vote on whether or not

1593
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,190
是否取消禁球
to end the lockout.

1594
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,490
同意取消禁球的委员
All those in favor of ending the lockout

1595
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,790
叫得名时请举手
will raise their right hand when called upon.

1596
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,330
[不同意取消禁球]
我先投，不举手
l will vote first by not raising my hand.

1597
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:29,600
加里森校长
Principal Garrison?

1598
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:36,010
夭了丽·沃克
Valerie Walker.

1599
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,010
楚伴什
Benson Chiu.

1600
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:43,150
家长代表，希匹沓先生
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1601
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:47,360
钮亘女士
And Ms. Nyugen.

1602
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,860
- 好  - 谢谢
- Yes.  - Thank you.

1603
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:07,910
投票结果四比二，委员会决定取消禁球
The lockout ends with a vote of 4 to 2.

1604
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:11,380
如果没有其他事，此次会议结束
lf there's no other business, this board meeting is adjourned.

1605
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,550
谢谢大家光临
Thank you all for coming.

1606
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,860
卡特先生
Mr. Carter.

1607
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:35,540
你一定有这样做么？
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1608
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,910
我们之间关系一直不是很好
Look, l know we haven't always seen eye to eye,

1609
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:42,880
但我能看出你是为了这些孩子好，不过方法不对…
but you've done such a great job with these boys, it seems wrong to just...

1610
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:46,950
我不想跟你争，我为这些孩子所做的
Look. No offense, ma'am, but all the work l did with those boys

1611
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:48,850
取消禁球时全被否定了
was negated when they ended the lockout.

1612
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,720
我不这样认为，我
l don't think that's true, l...

1613
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,860
委员会的决定发出的强有力的信息
The board sent the message loud and clear.

1614
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,820
赢球要比毕业
Winning basketball games is more important

1615
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:57,550
上大学更为重要
than graduating from high school and going to college.

1616
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,490
对不起，我不能支持这种观念
l'm sorry, l just can't support that message.

1617
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:54,540
先生，即使他们剪断门上的铁链，但我们还是不会打球
Sir, they can cut the chain off the door, but they can't make us play.

1618
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:00,780
先生，我们已经决定了，这件事有始就要有终
We've decided we're gonna finish what you started, sir.

1619
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,490
你快走吧，教练
Yeah, so leave us be, coach.

1620
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:05,350
我们还有好多要学，先生
We got shit to do, sir.

1621
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,480
我们最怕的不是别人看不起我们？
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.

1622
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:24,670
我最怕的是我们的前途无量
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

1623
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:29,020
我们真正怕的是我们光明的一面，不是我们阴暗的一面
lt is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.

1624
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:31,290
随波逐流者一世徒劳
Your playing small does not serve the world.

1625
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:33,120
没有努力就不会有成就
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking

1626
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:36,060
你身边的人也会因此为你自豪
so that other people won't feel insecure around you.

1627
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:40,060
我们都是前途无量
We were all meant to shine, as children do.

1628
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:43,230
不光是我们，所有人都一样
lt's not just in some of us, it's in everyone.

1629
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,690
让我们发挥潜能
And as we let our own light shine,

1630
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:48,700
我们身边的人自然而然也会效仿
we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.

1631
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:52,180
让我们自己从恐惧中解脱出来
As we are liberated from our own fear,

1632
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:55,240
我们的行为也能让他人解脱
our presence automatically liberates others.

1633
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:04,050
先生，我想说谢谢您
Sir, l just wanna say thank you.

1634
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:08,220
你拯救了我
You saved my life.

1635
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:19,500
谢谢你们，先生们
Thank you, sirs.

1636
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,270
你们所有的人
All of you.

1637
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:10,080
学习进程报告
Academic-progress reports, young men.

1638
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:13,090
简直是…
These things are...

1639
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:15,720
…难以置信
...unbelievable.

1640
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:18,990
我知道你们都尽力了
l know you've been trying.

1641
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:24,590
我所能说的就是
l guess there's only one way to say this.

1642
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,230
先生们，我们通过了，大家来打球！
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal. Let's play ball.

1643
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:36,040
里士啥？里士满！
Rich what? Richmond!

1644
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:38,650
里士啥？里士满！
Rich what? Richmond!

1645
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,840
里士啥？里士满！

连赢十七场

1663
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,190
一个去年才赢四场比赛的队伍，这就像灰姑娘的故事
A team that won only four games last year is now a Cinderella team

1664
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:28,590
一定有人想过，也许有可能

谢谢，你看起来也不错
Thank you. So do you.

1679
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,910
你还…
Considering.

1680
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:33,320
被禁球大家都像疯了一样
You know, everything's been crazy, with the lockout.

1681
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:34,990
会越来越好的
Yeah, it'll be all right.

1682
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:37,760
那是一定的
For sure.

1683
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,860
我们找个地方坐坐吧？
Can we sit down somewhere?

1684
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:03,510
我考虑了一下我的未来
l've been trying to get my head straight about things.

1685
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:06,320
好多事，尤其是关于你的
A lot of things. Especially us.

1686
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:09,190
- 肯尼，我  - 吉拉，听我说
- Kenny, l...  - Kyra, just listen.

1687
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:12,150
请听我说
Please.

1688
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:18,760
我生命中只有我妈，我队友和你
For a long time, it's just been my moms, my boys and you.

1689
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,530
你们是我生命的支柱
And that's what l counted on.

1690
01:52:20,910 --> 01:52:24,470
我试着想要不靠别人
l'm trying to count on myself now, and l'm all right and shit,

1691
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:29,050
但是没有你，生活便失去趣味
it's just, without you, nothing good feels as good.

1692
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:34,080
我失去了我平时高兴的那一面
lt's like l'm missing some happy part of me.

1693
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,290
我给你带了一些东西
l got you something.

1694
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:51,030
不是从九十九美分商店来的
And it ain't from the 99 Cent Store.

1695
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:55,330
闭嘴
Shut up.

1696
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:01,310
- 他们给你奖学金了  - 耶，宝贝儿，全奖学金的
- They gave you a scholarship?  - Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1697
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:06,210
噢，天哪，难以置信
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1698
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:08,610
噢，天哪
Oh, my gosh.

1699
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,580
我相信你到了那边一定会很出色的
l know you gonna kill it up there.

1700
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:13,260
不是的，应该是我们“两人”到了那边
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1701
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,860

1703
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,900

...there is no more baby.

1704
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:39,910
我最后决定不要了
l decided not to go through with it.

1705
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,050
吉拉
Kyra.

1706
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,420
我当时必须要做出决定
l had a choice to make,

1707
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:49,060
所以我就下了决心
so l made it.

1708
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,690
我得为自己着想，肯尼
For me, Kenny.

1709
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:57,530
那，什么时候…？
Well, when...?

1710
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:01,260
你为什么不告诉我呢？我会来陪你的
Why didn't you tell me? l would have gone with you.

1711
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:07,780
我实在对不起你
l'm so sorry.

1712
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:12,110
吉拉，我实在对不起你，让你自己负担这一切
Kyra, l'm so sorry you had to go through that by yourself.

1713
01:54:14,490 --> 01:54:17,280
我妈妈一直陪着我来着
My mom went with me.

1714
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,650

你应该去上大学，打篮球
l think you should go to school and play ball and do your thing.

1716

1779
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:53,250

Come here, come here. Damn it.

1782
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:03,000
听好了，大家伙儿一定注意防守
Come on, guys, keep up the defense!

1783
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:05,690
到底怎么办呢？
Come on, what you gonna do?

1784
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:08,800
我们不是还没输么，加油，小伙子们
We still in this game. Come on, fellas.

1785
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:12,940
先生们，你当初对我说你们能来比赛不是白给的
Gentlemen, you told me you deserved to be here.

1786
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:14,700
我看你们光说不做
Well, you're not playing like it.

1787
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:17,780
整个赛季，我们打的是我们自己的战术
All season long, we played our game.

1788
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:20,380
此时此刻，你们怎么这么被动呢
Right now, you're playing theirs.

赢得胜利的关键
we are pedal to the metal.

1791
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:29,450
我们不光是要打我们战术，给他们压力
We run the ball. We pressure the ball.

1792
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:34,960
最重要的是我们要控制比赛的路线
And most importantly, we control the tempo of the game!

1793
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:39,800
我们要打我们里士满钻井队的路线
We make them play Richmond Oiler ball.

1794
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
沃姆，你一定能那小子拿下
Worm, you can take this kid.

1795

逼他从左边上，等他从你身边过的时候
Force him left, and when he crosses over,

1796
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:46,970
突袭他，戴米恩，传的再快一点
you jump him. Damien, push the tempo.

1797
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:49,510
凯尼恩，莱尔，注意篮板
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards.

1798
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:53,240

Cruz, when you're in the game in transition, take that jumper you love.

1799
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:56,150
朱尼尔，给我加把力
Junior, just keep doing what you're doing.

1800
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:58,220
[大怪物指泰·克瑞恩]
把那个大怪物给我看住
Hold on to that monster.

02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:01,790
你们照我说的做，先生们，我向你保证
You do those things, gentlemen, and l guarantee you,

All right, baby, it's all us now. lt's all us. Let's go.

1839
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:44,550
他们已经上悬崖了，我们推他们一下，他们就掉下去了
They're standing on the edge of a cliff. All we gotta do is push them off.

1840
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:46,040
我们用坎蒂战术
We're gonna run Candy.

1841
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:48,240
沃姆，你给戴米恩打掩护
Worm, you gotta sell them the pass to Damien.

1842
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:51,250

Junior, we come to you on the weak-side seal.

1843
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:53,580
先生们，这场比赛你们应该赢
But, gentlemen, just because you deserve this

1844
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,380
但不代表他们会白白送给你们
doesn't mean they're gonna give it to you.

1845
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:59,460
属于你的东西，你就要拼命去争取，你们都准备好了吗？
Sometimes you gotta take what's yours. You ready to do this?

1846
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,260
- 当然，耶  - 给我上
- Hell, yeah.  - Let's go.

1847
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,830
- 好了，加油  - 把他们拿下
- All right, hands in.  - Come on, take this.

1848

1852
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:26,920
坎蒂战术！坎蒂战术！
Candy! Candy!

1853
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,650
球给我，戴米恩

02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:40,130
- 跑动，跑动  - 接应我，接应我
- Move, move.  - Help, help.

1855

朱尼尔，回底线！
Junior, get back!

1857
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:17,240
手举起来
Hands up!

1858
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:34,090
耶，这才是我，宝贝儿，耶
Yeah, that's what l'm talking about, baby. Yeah!

1859
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:29,200
野马！野马！
Mustangs! Mustangs!

1860
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:33,920
等等，等等，放我下来，巴特尔，巴特尔，巴特尔
Hold on, hold on. Let me down, let me down. Battle, Battle! Battle!

1861
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:39,610
你真有两下子，老兄，我是说真的
You're real, man. l mean that. All right?

1862
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:43,390
好了，抬起头来，老兄
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

1863
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:58,870
这好像和小说里写的不一样
Well, not quite your storybook ending, huh?

1864
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,510
起码我们今天没有
Not for us, anyway.

1865
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:06,910
但是你们和冠军没有什么两样
But you men played like champions.

1866
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:08,780
你们从未放弃
You never gave up.

1867
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:13,680
冠军都是斗志昂扬的
And champions hold their heads high.

1868
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:17,330
你们今天所做到的远要比输赢更重要
What you achieved goes way beyond the win-loss column

1869
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:19,330
比明天报纸
or what's gonna be written on the front page

1870
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:22,060
体育头版更重要
of the sports section tomorrow.

1871
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:24,060
你们所做到的是
You've achieved something that some people

1872
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:27,860
某些人一辈子追寻的
spend their whole lives trying to find.

1873
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:34,030
你们所做到的是战胜自我
What you achieved is that ever-elusive victory within.

1874
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,080
先生们…
And, gentlemen...

1875
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:41,380
…我为你们而非常骄傲
...l am so proud of you.

1876
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:48,520
四个月前，当我刚来里士满，是我有个计划
Four months ago, when l took the job at Richmond, l had a plan.

1877
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:51,660
计划没有成功
That plan failed.

1878
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:56,660
我是训练篮球队员的，你们却最终成为学生
l came to coach basketball players, and you became students.

1879
02:08:58,070 --> 02:09:00,470
我是训练男孩子的…
l came to teach boys...

1880
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:03,100
…你们却最终成为男人
...and you became men.

1881
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,440
就这一点，我要谢谢你们
And for that, l thank you.

1882
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:12,320
如果现在有人走进来
lf someone walked in this door right now

1883
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:18,110
对我说我可以挑加利福尼亚的任何一个高中球队任教
and offered me the coaching job at any school in the state of California,

1884
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:21,090
你知道我会挑哪一个么？
you know which team l'd choose?

1885
02:09:21,290 --> 02:09:23,390
圣弗朗西斯？
St. Francis?

1886
02:09:23,990 --> 02:09:26,220
我随便说说而已
l'm just saying, man.

1887
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:29,260
凯尼恩？
Kenyon?

1888
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:35,400
- 里士满！ - 里士啥？
- Richmond?  - Rich what?

1889
02:09:36,570 --> 02:09:38,540
- 里士满！ - 里士啥？
- Richmond.  - Rich what?

1890
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:39,900
里士满！
Richmond.

1891
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:42,700
- 里士啥？ - 里士满！
- Rich what?  - Richmond.

1892
02:09:42,910 --> 02:09:45,070
- 我们是哪里人？ - 里士满！
- Where we from?  - Richmond!

1893
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:47,720
- 我们家住哪？ - 里士满！
- What's my hometown?  - Richmond!

1894
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,940
- 我们最爱什么？ - 里士满！
- What do we love?  - Richmond!

1895
02:09:50,150 --> 02:09:52,420
- 里士啥？ - 里士满！
- Rich what?  - Richmond!

1896
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:17,820
里士满没有赢得全州大赛…

1897
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:25,300
但队员中五人得到了大学奖学金，六人上了大学

1898
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:33,000
朱尼尔·巴特尔以全额奖学金入取汕久斯大学

1899
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:44,800
杰森·莱尔上了圣地亚哥大学并取得了商业管理学位
