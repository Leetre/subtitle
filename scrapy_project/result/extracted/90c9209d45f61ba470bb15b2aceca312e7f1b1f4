1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,997
<i>...this is a busy time.</i>

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,356
<i>- So, if you wanna shop...
- Maybe a pedicure.</i>

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,477
<i>A pedicure?</i>

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,550
<i>Okay, that's where we draw the line.</i>

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,994
<i>That's it.</i>

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,117
<i>But in any event,
go to today. com</i>

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,112
<i>for all the rules
and regulations</i>

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,715
<i>and what you need to do,
'cause I'd love to come</i>

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,520
<i>and wake up with you.
All right.</i>

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,117
<i>Breakfast, tractor driving,
and shoveling...</i>

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,680
<i>Hey, big Boston Marathon,</i>

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,876
<i>9:00 a. m. tomorrow.</i>

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,679
<i>The wheelchairs go off
by noon.</i>

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,917
<i>Temperature about 50.
Partly sunny.</i>

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,754
<i>3:00, 55 degrees
and light winds.</i>

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,240
<i>It's gonna be a perfect day.</i>

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,600
<i>You know,
there is a renewed hope</i>

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,273
<i>for the Red Sox
after two of the last plays...</i>

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,556
Here we go, John.
Feeling good about this year.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,790
- You said it.
- Go Sox.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,914
Seriously?

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,914
Hey, Tom! Don't spray.
I'm walkin' through here.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
What's that smell?

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,713
Shit.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,794
Ah! Shit!

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,870
What'd you do?

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,950
<i>The chicken on the timer,</i>

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,030
<i>I didn't turn on by mistake,</i>

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,713
so I didn't hear the noise,
I didn't hear the beep.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,314
And if you hear the beeps,
then you'd be able to stop 'em...

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,470
<i>You're supposed to</i>

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
clear the roasters before
you empty the trash, Jeff.

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,389
...'cause I didn't hear
the beeps.

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,518
Okay, Maya, I'll sign off on an hour
of OT, so Jeff can help clean up.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,671
<i>- Does that work for both of you guys?
- Actually, sir, there's...</i>

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,070
I have something I gotta do.

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,480
What do you got's
so important...

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,995
You just make this big mess
and leave me here to clean it up?

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,357
Look, the Sox lost two in a row
because of me, all right?

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,352
I missed both games
because I was at work.

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,079
You know, I wasn't in my lucky seat
with my lucky beer.

42
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,231
You got a lucky beer?

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,436
Yeah, I mean, I just...

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,874
Beer in general's lucky,
right?

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,917
Okay, this is your call, Maya.

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,072
All right.

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,560
<i>I got you. Look at you.</i>

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,630
<i>Thank you, Maya.</i>

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,040
You owe me.

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
Do me a favor, sir.

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,596
Don't report
our office romance, okay?

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,955
I know it's against
Costco policy,

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,269
but sometimes you gotta
make a sacrifice, right?

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,999
Please go watch the game.

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,952
Here's my baby boy.

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,713
- Can I get another pitcher?
- Don't you think

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,154
he's gettin' too skinny,
Patty?

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,276
And he needs
a fuckin' haircut.

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,033
Friggin' perfect.

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,395
Look at that face.

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,073
The face is cute.

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,560
Shit!

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,915
Oh, Ma, hey.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,719
<i>- She's good.
- Careful, there.</i>

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,790
You wanna sit somewhere lower?
That fall's a doozy.

66
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,633
Yeah, you go
fuck yourself, sweetie.

67
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,951
All right, thanks. Hey.

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,313
<i>He's my favorite nephew.</i>

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,390
<i>Jesus, Jeff,</i>

70
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,994
you still smell like
fuckin' chicken carcasses.

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,037
Buchholz is on fire.
Look at him.

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,998
<i>- He's a fuckin' beast.
- That coulda been you, D.</i>

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,514
- On TV. Rich and famous.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,559
Ouit pitchin' in high school
like a fuckin' pussy.

75
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,313
You're a pussy.
Shut up, faggot.

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
Nobody says "faggot"
anymore, D.

77
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,200
Oh, really? What do you
know about it, huh?

78
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,999
What do you mean?
I'm down with the homos.

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,992
- My boss at Costco's gay.
- Your fuckin' boss?

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
You think
I get this fashionable

81
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,359
without it's some sort of
fuckin' insider help?

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,510
For the record, hey...

83
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,159
<i>For the record,
I didn't pussy outta shit.</i>

84
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,799
<i>I had a herniated disk.
You both know that.</i>

85
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,917
<i>Shut the fuck up, both of you.</i>

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,354
<i>You're an asshole. Shut up.</i>

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,159
Who you callin' a faggot,
Derek?

88
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,311
No, apparently we don't say
that word no more, Uncle Bob.

89
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,959
You know,
Jeff's boss is a gay.

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,873
What? He is!

91
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,952
<i>Have you been...
Where have you been?</i>

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,679
Not with
the rest of us, apparently.

93
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,712
Bauman?
You havin' a stroke or somethin'?

94
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,277
<i>Oh, shit. Look who's here.</i>

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,989
Hey, give me a second.

96
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,275
Nobody wants to fuck a guy
with chicken in his hair.

97
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,272
Why you touchin' my hair,
Uncle Bob?

98
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,829
Come back after she tells you
to go fuck yourself, okay?

99
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,434
<i>Sit down
and watch the game, bro.</i>

100
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,916
She broke up with you.

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,358
Hey.

102
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,553
- Are you...
- What?

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,438
Are...

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,316
<i>- The sister's here.
- Who? Gail?</i>

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,119
<i>- Yeah.
- She looks good, though.</i>

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,757
- Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,069
I, like... I texted you,

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,753
<i>like, six times.
You never get...</i>

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,991
Did you get my texts or not?

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,515
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah, I got 'em.

111
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,954
Cool.

112
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,355
- Hey, Gail.
- Jeff.

113
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,238
So what are you two
Amesbury ladies

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,800
slummin' it here for, anyway?

115
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,440
I'm collecting donations
for the Marathon.

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,677
- No shit?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

117
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,911
- All right.
- Yep.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,232
You got a jar, huh?
With pictures of yourself.

119
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,396
That's so great.

120
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,834
So you show people
pictures of yourself

121
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,196
- and then you ask for money.
- Yes. It usually works.

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,317
That's very...
That's a smart idea.

123
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,993
It feels like
you're self-promoting.

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,759
- That's really...
- I am.

125
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,240
That's literally what I'm doing.

126
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,913
Yeah, but you know what?
Like, if you try and pass this

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,235
around with
pictures of yourself,

128
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
it's gonna be like, it's...

129
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
You shouldn't do that.
You need my help.

130
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,237
- I already got...
- You're gonna need inside help.

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,551
Oh, really?
Gonna give money or what?

132
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,040
No. Hey! Listen up!

133
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,475
Hear ye! Hear ye!

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,550
Give me a heart attack.

135
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,194
Citizens of Chelmsford!

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,475
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Citizens of Chelmsford!

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,670
Jeff. Jeff.

138
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,275
This young lady here
is running the Marathon

139
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,194
for Brigham
and Women's Hospital. Okay?

140
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,114
Where she also works
as a big-shot administrator.

141
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,874
So skip a round o' Stella,
ya fat fucks!

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,794
And donate to a good cause.

143
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Yeah!

144
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,515
Hey, listen.

145
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,557
<i>Put your moolah
in the fishbowl.</i>

146
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Just a couple o' bucks.
All right?

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,510
Here ya go.

148
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,034
- She'll take food stamps...
- Stop smiling!

149
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,600
<i>...Chuck E. Cheese tickets,
whatever you got.</i>

150
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,239
- You are such a...
- What?

151
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,357
Whoever thought
you'd end up being in, like,

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,114
this torrid melodrama with
a chicken roaster from Costco?

153
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,431
What do you have against him?
He's a nice guy.

154
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,354
You broke up with him three times.
Real nice.

155
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
Erin! E.

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,915
E, E, E, E!
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,753
Can I come cheer ya on?

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,071
Why don't you
run it with her, Jeff?

159
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
Well, you know,
I suffered an injury

160
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,960
from a chicken-related

161
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,713
industrial accident today,
Gail, so, you know.

162
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,632
But, hey, I'm gonna be there
at the finish line for ya.

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,074
Don't the Red Sox
play tomorrow?

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,399
- So?
- So?

165
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,995
I'm gonna make
a big sign for ya!

166
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,152
I mean, that's gotta be worth
at least a dinner, right?

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,560
- Bye, Jeff.
- No, come on, I mean it!

168
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,438
I mean it.
Hey, I'm gonna be there, all right?

169
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,034
Take care
of your finger, Jeff.

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,156
Hey, I'll be there, all right?

E. E!

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,038
So lunch it is?

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,356
Oh, yeah. Go Sox.

175
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,677
It's too high.

176
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,275

- What, Ma?</i>

178
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,555
<i>Will you get me some aspirin?
'Cause I can't reach.</i>

179

<i>- Ma!
- Yeah!</i>

181
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,158
<i>There's an orange marker.
It was right here.</i>

182
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,879
- Don't make me shout, baby.
- Never mind.

183

Ma, it's on the...

186
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm gonna be late.

187
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,754
My God. Why do you
always put it up here?

188
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,435
Who puts it up here?
I don't understand.

189
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,239
- Thank you, baby.
- It's a new one. Yeah.

190
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
Okay. All right.

191
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
Hey, Can...
Can you fix the chirpy thing?

192
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,113
- What?
- Chirpy chirp.

193
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,078
What? You mean the low battery
alarm on the smoke detector?

194
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,435
Yeah, it's driving me
bat-shit crazy.

195
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,398
That's not a long drive.

196
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,834
You can't have
Uncle Bob come by

197
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,513
and do it on his way to work?

198

200
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,637
It's just a thing.

I don't know why you keep
tryin' with that girl anyway.

<i>So, Jeff came in bleeding

<i>and he was intubated
right away</i>

264
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,754
<i>and then
brought up immediately</i>

<i>to the operating room...</i>

266

<i>- Hi.
- I'm looking for Jeff Bauman.</i>

Um, you're gonna
have to sign in here.

268
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,995
Put his name here
and we'll find out where he is.

269
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,639
Um, can you tell me if
he's at this hospital, please?

270
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,790
<i>I... I can't tell you.</i>

271
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,314
I saw a picture.
I know he's at a hospital.

272
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,390
I just don't know which one.

273
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,199
Will you please just
tell me what floor he's on?

274
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,237
It's crazy right now.
I will help you.

275
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,839
<i>Jeff underwent a double
above-the-knee amputation.</i>

276
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,673
<i>Most of the destruction
had actually already been done</i>

277
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,150
<i>by the bomb below the knees,</i>

278
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,597
<i>and it was very obvious
to all the surgeons involved</i>

279
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,478
<i>that there was no way
to salvage anything</i>

280

<i>below the knee.</i>

281
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,276
<i>We had to get higher than
the knee to get clean skin,</i>

282
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,556
<i>clean muscle, clean tissue.</i>

283
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,639
Oh, my God.

284
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,079

287

<i>Well, as they look through all these</i>

<i>little pieces, Brian,

<i>inside a pressure cooker pot.</i>

291
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,790
<i>And in there were nails,
BBs, and ball bearings</i>

292
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,031
<i>to magnify the destructive</i>

293
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,680
<i>and injury-causing nature
of the blast.</i>

294
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,116
<i>And the explosive
was gunpowder.</i>

295

<i>Uh, the blast wounded
more than 140 people...</i>

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,072
I'm sorry, I'm, um,
looking for Patty Joyce.

312
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,276
I'm Patty.

313
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,555
<i>Did you not hear us?</i>

314
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,120
<i>- I'm Kevin Horst. Uh...
- Who?</i>

315
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,556
I'm Jeff's manager at Costco.

316
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,630
<i>Check his ID.</i>

317
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,154
These reporters
will try everything.

318
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You... You called, right?

319
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,916
<i>Yeah, Jeff talks about ya.</i>

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,117
Well, ya heard
what happened, huh?

321
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,714
Yeah.

322
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,670
You know our son
lost his legs, right?

323
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,673
- I know.
- And you brought breakfast?

324
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,160
- That's not helpful.
- Uh, thank you very much.

325
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,515
<i>Maybe we should
wait to eat 'em</i>

326
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,829
so you can go
grab your camera.

327
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,479
<i>Take a picture
for your Costco newsletter.</i>

328
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,950
I'm... Really, I'm happy
to bring whatever you like.

329
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,952
<i>What could you possibly
get us that we need right now, Kevin?</i>

330
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,430
Well, I took the liberty
of printing up...

331
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,119
<i>A fucking joke.
You kiddin' me?</i>

332
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,193
...his policy,
and I've highlighted the areas

333
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,475
that you'll need to sign.

334
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,791
Don't sign nothin'
without a goddamn lawyer!

335
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,200
Can you just let him talk
for a second?

336
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,316
<i>Who are you again?</i>

337
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,390
<i>Yeah, shut the fuck up
and let him talk.</i>

338
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,709
What's he gonna say
that we need to hear right now?

339
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,916
I don't know.

340
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,356
Okay, answer me this.
Answer me this.

341
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,399
My son makes it through this,
where's he gonna work, Kevin?

342
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,550
Where's he gonna work?

343
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,030
Hmm? You gonna hire him back?

344
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,112
Jesus Christ.
We need this right now?

345
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,078
Yes, we do!

346
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,039
Who's gonna hire him
without any legs, Patty?

347
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,759
<i>We can't rehire him, sir.</i>

348
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,910
See? I told ya.

349
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,195
Mr. Bauman, please,
let me finish.

350
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,350
We can't rehire him,

351
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,796
'cause he'll never have
stopped working for us.

352
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,674
We're not letting Jeff go.

353
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,719
And these... This is stupid.
But this is just...

354
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,235
You know, this is just
to get the insurance goin'

355
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,754
and get that rollin'.

356
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,956
<i>Wait, insurance?</i>

357
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,759
<i>Yes.</i>

358
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,354
Jeffrey has insurance?

359
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,716
Of course, of course. Um...

360
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,875
Plus legal, mental health,
or financial advice

361
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,237
for Jeff or any member
of the family.

362
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,597
And I've included
my personal cell...

363
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,318
...at the top there. Um...

364
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,198
All right, good.

365
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,194
That's good. I'm glad you guys
are doin' the right thing.

366
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,875
<i>So, what kinda
muffins we got there?</i>

367
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,999
<i>All of those things happened</i>

368
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,434
<i>in preparation for this event.</i>

369
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,920
<i>But there was
no specific intelligence</i>

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,150
<i>that anything
was going to happen.</i>

371
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,310
<i>At this point in time,
it's too early</i>

372
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,516
<i>to get into the specifics.</i>

373
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,875
<i>These were powerful devices</i>

374
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,917
<i>that resulted
in serious injuries.</i>

375
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,310
<i>Do you have
someone in custody?</i>

376
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,511
<i>Those reports are not true.</i>

377
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,159
<i>There is no suspect
in custody.</i>

378
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,760
<i>We're questioning many people,</i>

379
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,480
<i>but there is no one in custody
at this point in time.</i>

380
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,433
Jeff?

381
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,716
Holy shit. Are you awake, bro?

382
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,034
You hear me?

383
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,320
Okay. Okay, okay.

384
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,479
Uh, so I gotta tell ya,
there was an explosion.

385
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,592
And your fuckin' legs...

386
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,514
<i>They're gone, bro.</i>

387
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,994
What are you doin', buddy?

388
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,192
I can't tell what
your fingers are doin'.

389
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,794
What, you wanna
write somethin'?

390
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,195
Hold on.

391
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,598
Here, buddy, here.
Here's a pen.

392
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,239
Yeah, grab that.

393
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,598
<i>Erin? Erin, yeah, she's fine,
she's here. She's...</i>

394
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,151
<i>The whole family's here.
Everyone's down the hall.</i>

395
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,755
You okay? How you feelin'?

396
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,555
"Lieutenant Dan"?

397
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,439
You mean the guy from
"Forrest Gump" with no legs?

398
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,678
Oh, shit. Don't move.

399
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,596
Bob, Bob, wake up!

400
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,955
What the hell, D?

401
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,315
- Jeff's awake.
- Huh?

402
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,834
He wrote this.

403
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,754
- The last part.
- Holy shit.

404
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,753
<i>- What happened? D?
- He's awake.</i>

405
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,991
<i>- Where's the FBI office?
- Bob.</i>

406
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,316
<i>- Hey!
- Bob.</i>

407
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,595
<i>- Hey!
- Bob.</i>

408
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,240
Hey!

409
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,720
<i>Jeffie.</i>

410
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,473
<i>Cut it down, guys.
'Cause he just... just...</i>

411
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,313
Jeffrey? Hey, baby.

412
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,791
<i>Oh, my God, we are so happy
you're back with us.</i>

413
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,314
<i>Um, uh, now listen,</i>

414
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,076
some of the FBI guys
are gonna come in.

415
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,279
They're gonna ask ya, you know, a...
a few questions.

416
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,999
<i>So... Okay?</i>

417
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,517
<i>And all ya gotta do
is just tell 'em what ya saw.</i>

418
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,750
<i>That's great.</i>

419
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,956
<i>We're removing
the intubation tube.</i>

420
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,315
<i>We need everyone to clear out.</i>

421
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
But we just got...

422
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,280
We'll be back.

423
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,680
<i>We're just getting ready
to take the breathing tube out.</i>

424
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,752
<i>- It'll be okay.
- See ya later.</i>

425
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,593
- It'll be okay.
- Let's go. Let's go.

426
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,512
We gotta get
that tube out, okay?

427
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,317
You ready, buddy?

428
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,359
What's wrong, bud?
You want her?

429
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,636
Yeah. I'mma let her stay.
It's okay.

430
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,837
It's okay.
You're all right, buddy.

431
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,354
Relax, okay?

432
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,715
All right, we have
a couple minutes of hubbub

433
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,393
before we get the tube out.

434
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,994
Open your mouth. We just gonna
clean your mouth first.

435
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,799
Then we're gonna get
that tube out.

436
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,032
Relax. Let me just take off
some tape. Perfect.

437
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,839
- Slow breaths.
- We have a cuff link.

438
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,037
Here we go, bud. Ready?

439
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,998
One, two, three.
Take a big breath.

440
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,317
Big breath, big breath.
Big breath.

441
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,470
Take a big breath.

442
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,280
Okay. Relax, relax.

443
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,671
Slow breaths. She's just gonna
suction your mouth again.

444
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,160
Slow breaths, bud.

445
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,390
Good job. Can you say "Hi"?

446
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,675
Hi.

447
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,556
Okay, good job, good job.

448
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,710
We're gonna put
this mask on.

449
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,956
Put that on. Relax.

450
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,633
All right.
You can talk to him,

451
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,080
but he can't answer you, okay?

452
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,958
- Okay.
- Yes and no.

453
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,798
Okay? All right, buddy.

454
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,714
<i>- Great job, great job.
- Good to go, kid.</i>

455
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,833
- Hey, E.
- Mm?

456
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,639
You're sittin' on my leg.

457
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,034
Oh.

458
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,479
- Hi.
- Hi.

459
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,040
No talking. No talking.

460
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,910
I'm a tough guy.

461
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,150
No talking.

462
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,999
I know you're tough.

463
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,870
Is he in there tellin' 'em
about the bomber?

464
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,280
Yeah, I think so.

465
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,151
Fuckin' miracle.
My boy. Fuckin' hero.

466
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,395
You bet.

467
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,755
<i>Sorta the same
kinda build,</i>

468
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,309
but, like,
maybe a little taller.

469
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
But I looked him
right in the eyes,

470
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,554
<i>so he's the same...</i>

471
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,438
Was he young or old?

472
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,433
Young... he was young.

473
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,712
Yeah.

474
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,553
<i>What do you remember
after the blast?</i>

475
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,114
<i>Uh...</i>

476
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,993
There was, like, this smell.

477
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,353
Like, it smelled like...

478
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,192
Take your time.

479
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,398
Like the Fourth of July.

480
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,071
<i>...is now, in fact, we know, dead.</i>

481
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,759
<i>All right, Dr. Schoenfeld,
thank you so much forjoining us.</i>

482
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,990
<i>We really appreciate it.</i>

483
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,316
<i>Obviously, Dr. Schoenfeld,
limited by what he can say</i>

484
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,153
<i>because of the situation,
obviously,</i>

485
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,675
<i>this huge manhunt
being watched worldwide.</i>

486
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,355
<i>An individual,
Suspect Number 1,</i>

487
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,159
<i>uh, now dead, we know.</i>

488
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,038
Fuckin' A!

489
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,077
- Oh, my God!
- You son of a bitch!

490
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,915
Fuckin' kill
that other son of a bitch, too!

491
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,197
Jeffrey, I just met Carlos.

492
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,118
<i>He's the guy
who saved your life.</i>

493
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,552
<i>Would you like a coffee?</i>

494
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,871
<i>I brought some...
I've got some... got some coffees.</i>

495
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,477
Don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

496
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,512
<i>I think everyone
in that hospital</i>

497
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,478
<i>is thinking that same thing.</i>

498
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,596
Yeah.

499
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,316
We broke up about a month ago,
me and Jeff.

500
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,398
It's not the first time...
we usually get back together.

501
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,434
<i>Not this time?</i>

502
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,431
Doesn't show up
for anything.

503
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,637
He's always late.

504
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,792
You know, he... he never wants
to leave his apartment.

505
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,473
I'm just fed up with it.

506
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,553
And then he shows up.

507
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,794
<i>Sounded like
multiple assault rifle shots to me.</i>

508
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,315
<i>8:15 p. m.,
a person is cornered</i>

509
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,312
<i>on a boat in a yard
in Watertown.</i>

510
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,880
<i>A suspect in the boat.</i>

511
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,950
<i>Hundreds of law enforcement...</i>

512
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,599
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

513
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,796
<i>Jeff, how you doin'?</i>

514
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,519
<i>So, Jeff, we have to do</i>

515
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,954
<i>the first dressing change today.</i>

516
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,793
<i>Okay, we're gonna take
these bandages off.</i>

517
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,593
<i>I'm not looking.</i>

518
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,955
<i>Things get too rough,
please let us know</i>

519
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,997
<i>and we can figure out
how to help you.</i>

520
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,594
I'm sorry?

521
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,909
And did you
already pre-medicate him

522
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,354
<i>- for the dressing change?
- Yep.</i>

523
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,831
<i>He's already gotten his oxy
and his dilaudid PO.</i>

524
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,991
He has a PR in fentanyl
for breakthrough.

525
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,514
And I have plenty
in my pocket.

526
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,920
<i>Now some people like to look.</i>

527
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,320
<i>Some people
don't like to look at all.</i>

528
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,357
No. I don't wanna
look at me now.

529
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,035
<i>So, Marion, if you
can hold up the right leg...</i>

530
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,349
<i>- Okay.
- ...that would be very helpful,</i>

531
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,716
<i>and we'll unwrap 'em now.</i>

532
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,996
All righty.
I'm gonna just lift ya up.

533
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,070
You're gonna feel my hands.

534
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,310
I'm sorry, hon.

535
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,680
<i>So I'm just taking the tape off,</i>

536
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>and I'm gonna unwrap
the Ace bandage first.</i>

537
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,312
<i>This shouldn't be too bad.</i>

538
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,234
<i>But if you have
any sharp pains or anything,</i>

539
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,835
<i>please let me know.</i>

540
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,240
All right,
you're gonna feel my hands.

541
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
Tell me if you're ready.
Did that kick in yet?

542
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,633
- Doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

543
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,120
All right.

544
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,199
Almost done with the gauze.

545
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,393
Fuck.

546
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,550
<i>You okay?</i>

547
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,916
Yeah.

548
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,231
<i>You let us know
if you need a break, okay?</i>

549
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,320
You're okay.

550
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,754
Don't look at 'em.

551
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,990
I'm not lookin' at 'em.

552
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,150
Okay, now
this might be a little sticky.

553
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,515
- Looking at you.
- God!

554
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,829
<i>Doin' great. Doin' great.</i>

555
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,071
<i>You're doin' awesome.</i>

556
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,800
Okay, the dressing's off.
We'll give you a minute.

557
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,277
- Nice little breaths.
- Good job.

558
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,272
In your nose,
out your mouth.

559
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,510
<i>You're doing so great.</i>

560
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,920
<i>That was the worst.</i>

561
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,480
Getting the dressings off
is the worst.

562
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,233
<i>Want a little more fentanyl?</i>

563
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,593
Okay.

564
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,160
<i>'Cause now we're gonna</i>

565
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,230
<i>take off the dressing
on the left side, okay?</i>

566
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,595
Yeah.

567
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,836
<i>You mind going
over there, Marion?</i>

568
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,115
We're just gonna set up.
We're not touching anything yet.

569
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,634
We're just settin' up.

570
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,598
Just gonna shimmy
this down a little.

571
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,080
Okay.

572
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,560
All right, I'm gonna lift up,
one, two, three.

573
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,710
You're gonna feel this again.

574
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,075
Pretty much
just like the other one.

575
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,637
Sorry, hon.
- Okay.

576
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,949
Do you want...
I have the fentanyl in my pocket.

577
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,030
Do you want me
to give you that?

578
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,873
Yeah, yeah.
Let's give that to him.

579
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,474
<i>All right, we're gonna take a break.</i>

580
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,755
<i>We'll give you
some more medicine.</i>

581
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,956
Okay, let me just get to...

582
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,235
I'm just gonna
work around you,

583
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,595
so I'm just gonna
get to my IV.

584
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,875
We're almost done.

585
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,235
Now, same thing,
dried blood, big pull.

586
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,640
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

587
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,872
That's it, that's it.

588
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,280
Right here.

589
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,276
Hey.

590
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,830
Hey.

591
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,196
Was I asleep?

592
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,239
Yeah.

593
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,840
A good two hours.

594
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,951
You need a haircut.

595
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,560
- No shit.
- Mmm-hmm.

596
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,193
You need to wash it.

597
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,634
- No.
- Yes.

598
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,274
- No.
- Yes.

599
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,999
Still smells like...

600
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,718
You should have seen
the sign I made for ya.

601
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,870
What'd it say?

602
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,079
Had, like, 3D letters
and everything.

603
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,199
Hey.

604
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,920
I'm sorry.

605
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,113
I'm sorry.

606
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,233
Don't say that.

607
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,960
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

608
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,434
Don't say that.

609
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,477
You don't owe me anything.

610
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,918
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

611
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,795
What's that?

612
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,475
I don't know.

613
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,837
Maybe they caught
the other guy.

614
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,157
<i>Bye, Jeff.
We're so proud of you.</i>

615
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,349
<i>...hours ago</i>

616
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,631
<i>now seems to be finally over.</i>

617
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,712
<i>The last suspect
being searched for, police...</i>

618
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,439
<i>According to
Boston Police Department...</i>

619
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,638
It's nice
they turned out for ya.

620
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,791
I think... I think he wants
to do it himself.

621
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,950
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

622
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,679
I'm gonna lock you off, honey.
I'll lock you off.

623
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,080
<i>Hold on. Okay.</i>

624
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,230
You just let me know
if you wanna...

625
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,152
Thanks, Kevin. Thanks.

626
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,720
<i>Take a picture with Erin for us.</i>

627
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,156
<i>Does it feel good to be going home?</i>

628
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,239
<i>Is Carlos Arrendondo your guardian angel?</i>

629
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,879
<i>They hated each other,</i>

630
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,270
and that's why
Pete got busted for it.

631
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,192
'Cause Bob was using
his computer.

632
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,112
<i>And Pete didn't rat him out.</i>

633
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,192
<i>And he... he almost
had to go to jail for that.</i>

634
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,634
<i>It was in the papers
and all that.</i>

635
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,473
<i>- Hey, listen, look at this.
- Hey.</i>

636
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,233
<i>Ain't that somethin'?</i>

637
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,310
<i>- Oh, my...
- Both sides.</i>

638
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,516
"Boston Strong."

639
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,590
<i>Let... we gotta wave.</i>

640
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,319
<i>- What does that even mean?
- Wave.</i>

641
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,312
<i>You're a national fuckin' hero, kiddo.</i>

642
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,436
<i>You wave, Jeff.</i>

643
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,233
<i>They're all out for ya.</i>

644
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,674
<i>You're a real hero.</i>

645
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,160
<i>Isn't that somethin'?</i>

646
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,560
And it's just the start.

647
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,756
<i>That's really somethin'.</i>

648
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,479
<i>I'm a hero for standin' there</i>

649
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,280
<i>and getting my legs blown off?</i>

650
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,880
<i>Yeah, what are ya talkin' about?</i>

651
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,713
<i>That's the HOV
for electric vehicles and whatnot.</i>

652
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,315
No, like, for, uh...
it's just for handicap cars.

653
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,790
No, no, there's no
handicap drivin' lane.

654
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,792
<i>Jesus, what a bunch of morons.</i>

655
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,200
<i>Okay, we're fuckin' morons,</i>

656
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,839
'cause we care about
people with disabilities?

657
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,115
Ooh, ooh, Jeff, Jeff! He's here.

658
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,316
Fuck you.

659
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,436
- All right, let's do this.
- Yes!

660
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,477
Come on.
Look out.

661
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,550
Hey.

662
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,516
<i>I got this back there.</i>

663
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,239
<i>Oh, shit, don't pull it.</i>

664
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,039
Okay, got it, buddy?

665
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,351
Got the back?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

666
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,873
Patty, I still think
Jeffie could live with me.

667
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,759
Oh, yeah, all the way
up there in Cow-Hampshire.

668
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,160
All his friends are here,
ya idiot.

669
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,391
<i>All due respect,
I got more room than all of yas.</i>

670
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,790
And I'm the only one
with a credit score above 520.

671
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,996
<i>I'm the one got a pool.</i>

672
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,594
<i>Above fucking ground!</i>

673
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,436
Oh, careful, careful.

674
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,591
Oh, ow, ow.

675
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,080
For God's sakes!

676
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,720
Jesus! My shin splints.

677
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,075
God. You're gonna have to get

678
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,435
a place with a ramp
or an elevator.

679
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,591
We're all gonna end up
in a fuckin' wheelchair.

680
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,399
Not a tingle in your leg...

681
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,551
He's home!
That's all that matters.

682
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,233
- God, I got a lot to do and...
- So psyched.

683
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,959
God.

684
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,713
Oh, my God, I thought it was
gonna be better than this.

685
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,234
- Yeah, look at this, huh?
- Where's Jeffie?

686
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,549
- Oh, Jeff. You okay?
- Hey, there he is.

687
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,790
All right. This is it.

688
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,109
This is it. Welcome home!

689
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,839
Is it good to be back?

690
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,389
Oh, my God, it's a little
crazy at the moment,

691
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,154
because people, you know,
they send you these...

692
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,391
- This stuff...
- It's, uh, every day.

693
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,994
- It's, like, packages.
- From all over the world!

694
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,912
Packages all over the place.

695
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,391
Ya gonna have to look at some
of these, son, at some point.

696
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,199
That and toys and packages.

697
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,078
What was that place?
Micro-somethin'.

698
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,480
Uh, yeah, yeah.

699
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,789
Oh, Micronesia or somethin'.

700
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,910
Yeah.

701
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,559
<i>Swear to God, it's true.</i>

702
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,951
Yeah, stuff...
Stuff comes for ya from... Oh, my God.

703
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,872
I dunno. I dunno.

704
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,952
You, shut up.
You just shut up.

705
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,156
Ma.

706
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,469
We're gonna have a party now.
I'm gonna get ya a beer.

707
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,960
- Thank you.
- I'll get ya a beer, right?

708
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,110
Oh, can he drink yet?

709
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,317
<i>'Course he can drink.
Didn't cut his balls off.</i>

710
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,709
It's cute.

711
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,951
<i>The whole world's
watchin' ya, kid.</i>

712
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,714
Yeah, you're like a symbol
to a lot of people.

713
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,836
For what?

714
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,434
Ya know,
you're Boston Strong, right?

715
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,749
- Huh?
- We're proud of you, Jeff.

716
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,797
I'll have
one of them beers, Patty.

717
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,434
E.

718
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,989
Can you help...

719
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,070
Can you give me
a hand for a second?

720
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,276
Yeah.

721
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,596
What do you need?

722
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,319
Uh, to the, uh, bathroom.

723
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,471
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- Yeah.

724
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,795
<i>Some pizza, Bob?</i>

725
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,678
I'd love a piece,
Big Jeff, thank you.

726
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,830
<i>All right.
You gonna come get it</i>

727
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,320
or you'd like me
to serve it to you?

728
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,834
<i>I'd like you to serve it to me.</i>

729
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,673
- Do you need the chair?
- No.

730
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,155
I got it.

731
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,639
- You okay?
- Yeah. I think.

732
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,792
Take off my...
Yeah.

733
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,757
Careful of your bandages.

734
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,320
I got it, I got it.

735
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,279
I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

736
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,033
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,670
You wanna close that?

738
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,279
Do you want me to close it?

739
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,350
Yup.

740
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,839
You can just
hand me your stuff.

741
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,149
What?

742
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,435
<i>You can just
hand me your clothes.</i>

743
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,199
Here.

744
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,593
<i>You can go, Erin.</i>

745
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,313
You sure?

746
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,959
<i>Call me
if you need me, okay?</i>

747
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,474
<i>I don't need a doctor.</i>

748
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,472
<i>Oh, shut the fuck up, Bob.</i>

749
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,118
<i>What time is it?</i>

750
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,157
<i>You know what time it is,
and we have to be going.</i>

751
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,836
<i>Jeffrey?</i>

752
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,071
<i>Jeffrey, good morning.</i>

753
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,840
<i>Jeffrey, are you awake?</i>

754
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,038
<i>Gonna be late for rehab.</i>

755
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,873
<i>Come on.</i>

756
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,276
No, I'm up. No, I'm up, Ma.

757
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,751
Oh. Okay. All right.
I think he's...

758
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,156
<i>I got my coat.
I... I'm wearing my coat.</i>

759
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,356
<i>This is what I'm wearing.</i>

760
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,190
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

761
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,275
Fuck.

762
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,192
<i>Jeffrey?</i>

763
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,033
<i>Sweetie, Jeffrey,
are you okay?</i>

764
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,519
- I hear it.
- Shh!

765
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,911
<i>Jeffrey! Just tell me
you're okay, baby.</i>

766
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,150
I don't know what he's doing.

767
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,714
What do you think is going on?

768
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,995
Jesus, Patty, what do you
think boys do in their room

769
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,799
when they lock their door?

770
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,678
- Yeah, I think he's doin' it.
- You think he...

771
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,672
The kid's got no legs,
and he's blowin' loads.

772
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,353
<i>Dirty fucking...</i>

773
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,430
<i>Jeffrey?</i>

774
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,680
<i>It's gonna be very special, Jeffie.</i>

775
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,395
Everybody wants to see ya.

776
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,472
See how good you're doin'.

777
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,596
I just wish you would have

778
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,915
let somebody
cut your freakin' hair.

779
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,070
Oh, stop pickin' on him.

780
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,833
It's gonna be good.

781
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,196
Hello.

782
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,351
Hi. He's doin' good.

783
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,557
He has an appointment. So...

784
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,200
I'm his Aunt Jenn.
I'm here for support.

785
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,509
<i>After the bomb blast</i>

786
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,831
<i>at the Boston Marathon
took most of his legs,</i>

787
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,752
<i>28-year-old
Chelmsford resident</i>

788
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,877
<i>Jeff Bauman
is lucky to be alive,</i>

789
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,475
<i>but his real struggle
has just begun.</i>

790
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,678
<i>Bauman told reporters
that he will one day walk again.</i>

791
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,114
<i>After multiple surgeries</i>

792
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,317
<i>and endless
painful rehabilitation,</i>

793
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,880
<i>many people would give up.</i>

794
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,400
<i>- Erin, come here!
- But with the support</i>

795
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,278
<i>- of his family and friends...
- Jeff's on TV!</i>

796
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,919
- My Jeff?
- Come here.

797
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,400
<i>...supporters
all over the world.</i>

798
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,960
<i>Jeff Bauman
has found something amazing</i>

799
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,316
<i>here at Spaulding Hospital.</i>

800
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,471
<i>That something is called hope.</i>

801
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,472
<i>In the days following
the Marathon bombing,</i>

802
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,991
<i>this photograph showed the carnage
at the finish line.</i>

803
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,151
<i>Jeff Bauman was standing
next to one of the bombs</i>

804
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,392
<i>when it detonated,
obliterating his legs.</i>

805
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,199
<i>A day later,
from his hospital bed,</i>

806
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,430
<i>Bauman scribbled a note.</i>

807
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,910
<i>"I know what happened."</i>

808
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,990
<i>He's a real hero, my son.</i>

809
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,072
<i>He's helpin' this city heal.</i>

810
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,554
<i>Be Boston Strong.</i>

811
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,710
<i>Is that true, Jeff?</i>

812
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,075
<i>Are you Boston Strong?</i>

813
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,236
<i>You did real good today, kiddo.</i>

814
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,750
That kind of exposure,
you know...

815
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,479
That could lead
to opportunities.

816
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,239
Make things, you know,

817
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,277
easier for ya...

818
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,873
<i>- Yeah.
- ...down the line.</i>

819
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,318
<i>You got a call from Carlos.</i>

820
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,119
<i>He wants to visit with ya.</i>

821
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,039
And we should
be thankful for him.

822
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,271
<i>In here. Hey.</i>

823
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,390
Sir, how you doin'?

824
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,550
- Hi. How are you?
- Paul Martino.

825
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,359
- How are you, Paul?
- Nice to meet you.

826
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,159
Uh, casts shouldn't
take more than...

827
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,600
- hour, hour and a half.
- Okay.

828
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,797
Cast is a very
quick procedure,

829
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,712
but it's
the most important part.

830
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,996
If we get
a good impression of you,

831
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,033
then the rest of the procedure
is gonna go nicely.

832
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,634
- You okay?
- Yeah.

833
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,473
We're gonna start
on this side, okay?

834
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,473
We're gonna slip a sock
on you here.

835
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,517
It's just
a cotton stocking that...

836
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,831
This is so that when
we wrap the plaster on you,

837
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,151
it doesn't stick
directly to your skin.

838
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,674
Did you hear the one

839
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,752
where the farmer
was paintin' his bathroom?

840
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,197
Figured he'd shellac
the toilet seat, make it look prettier.

841
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,158
He didn't tell his wife.

842
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,435
<i>Daughter says,
"What's the matter, Dad?</i>

843
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,034
<i>Ain't you ever seen
one of these before?"</i>

844
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,157
He says, "Yeah, I just never
saw anybody frame it."

845
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,831
<i>Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, Jeff.</i>

846
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,240
<i>Don't make him
laugh too hard.</i>

847
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,640
<i>...allow this to get hard.</i>

848
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,040
And then we're gonna
make a slice in it.

849
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,152
We're gonna take it
right off you, okay?

850
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,755
<i>Maybe you could, uh,
use your new legs</i>

851
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,992
for next week
at the Bruins game, huh?

852
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,355
Ma, that's, like,
in a week.

853
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,716
- Yep.
- Give me a couple of weeks

854
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,830
<i>of fabrication and delivery.</i>

855
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,195
<i>Get outta here.</i>

856
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,350
<i>Couple of weeks, Jeff,
you'll be up.</i>

857
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,635
I can't wait.

858
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,035
<i>We can get you up any time.</i>

859
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,236
We're gonna clean up this side

860
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,720
and then we'll go on
and do the right.

861
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,790
We'll be just as quick, and...

862
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,075
I wanna have it signed.

863
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,879
<i>- Less pain. Okay...
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

864
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,189
<i>...but at least you know
what to expect.</i>

865
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,316
Right.

866
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,954
They've asked him to go out

867
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,269
on the ice and wave the flag.

868
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,714
<i>Jonny Gomes
coming to the plate here</i>

869
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,950
<i>- for the Red Sox.
- Let's go, Jonny!</i>

870
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,235
Get us a fuckin' hit.

871
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,595
<i>Be one to one now.</i>

872
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,637
Don't swing at that shit.
Let that shit go.

873
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,394
<i>Gomes with a special bat in hand,</i>

874
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,755
<i>to remember the victims</i>

875
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,752
<i>- of the Marathon...
- Hey, Jeff!</i>

876
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,356
You hear that?
His bat says "Boston Strong."

877
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,636
<i>Hey, leave him be.
He's snappin' a deuce.</i>

878
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,313
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

879
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,629
<i>God damn it.</i>

880
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,240
<i>Not too good, huh?</i>

881
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,800
<i>No, he fouled up.</i>

882
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,075
After everything
we've been through?

883
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,435
Haven't we suffered enough?

884
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,079
Hey, so is he gonna do it?

885
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,231
<i>Oh, I dunno. He's nervous.</i>

886
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,959
He's nervous about what?

887
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,474
<i>Jeff, we heard
about the Bruins game!</i>

888
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,835
<i>Sounds pretty cool, bro.</i>

889
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,910
<i>They're gonna give us box seats.</i>

890
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,990
<i>Wait, us?</i>

891
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,116
<i>Said we could
bring the whole crew.</i>

892

- Yo, you gotta do this, Jeff!
- Free drinks!

893
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,393
<i>The Bruins need ya!</i>

894
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,675
<i>Don't be a pussy, bro!</i>

895
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,080
Shit. Ow!

896
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,190
<i>What kinda food they got?</i>

<i>It's all-you-can-eat, Jeff.
Come on, man...</i>

899
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,789
<i>...stop being selfish about this shit.</i>

900

<i>Is that my phone?</i>

<i>- What?
- Can you hear me now?</i>

909
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,160
Yeah, I can hear you.

910

How you doin'?

911
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,195
Yeah, you know.

912
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,313
Hey, so I hope...

913
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,869
I hope... I hope
I didn't get ya at a bad time,

914
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,270
but I, uh, you know,
it's the, uh,

915
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,114
<i>Bruins playoff game
against Chicago next week,</i>

916
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,194
and they asked me
to come out there on the ice.

917
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,794
On the ice?

918
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,837
Yeah, I'm not, like, on the...
Not to play,

919
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,151
but, y'know,
to be the banner captain

920
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,714
and, like,
wave the flag and shit.

921
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,395
<i>It's kind of like
singin' the national anthem,</i>

<i>but for people
who suck at singing.</i>

923
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,674
You sure you wanna do that?

924
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,310
Well, everybody says I should.
It's the Stanley Cup, so...

925
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,715
<i>Listen, Erin, I...
I know we're not together, but...</i>

I was just, um...

927
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,238
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted

00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,993
to come with me

929

<i>I don't think that
I could do it without you.</i>

930

And I know that
it's not really fair of me to say.

931
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,353
I'm really...
I'm sorry, um...

932

But I...

933
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,037
I really need you right now.

940

<i>all over the news last night.</i>

941
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,755
<i>Jeff, he told the story,

942
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,194
- You all right?
- Yeah...

943
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,634
Gonna squeeze through
and get outta your way...

944
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,837
<i>- Mom's way here.
- Oh, thank you.</i>

945
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,831
Let's go, Boston!

946
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,559
All right!

947
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,314
<i>Okay, a toast, a toast!</i>

948
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,120
You cool?

949
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,316
Yeah, I'm good.

950
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,599
<i>Know why
they call Chicago the windy city?</i>

<i>'Cause you guys blow!</i>

952
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,792
- Do you have a smoke?
- Oh, oh.

953
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,760
Jeff, we'd like to, uh,
stage you sooner.

954
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,830
- Oh, yeah.
- If that's all right.

955
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,956
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

956
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,673
<i>- Okay.

00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,274
<i>And now...</i>

959
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,760
<i>Ooh, big crowd out there.</i>

960
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,399
<i>Completely full tonight.</i>

961
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,919
<i>Hey, don't be nervous.</i>

962
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,114
How are you doin', Jeff?

963
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,714
- Yeah, I'm great.
- You okay?

964
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,280
Just stop here.

965
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,192
- I'm gonna get the flag.
- Yeah.

966
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,279
Here's the flag, Jeff.

967
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,431
I'm gonna be standin'
right over there,

968
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,160
and then I'm gonna signal you
when to come out, okay?

969
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,390
<i>All right? Have fun.</i>

970
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,756
<i>Have fun, okay? Get pumped.</i>

971
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,876
Uh...

972
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,317
I don't think
I can do this, E.

973
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,596
<i>Jeff, look,
it's gonna be okay.</i>

974
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,117
You just wave the flag.
And then you leave. Right?

975
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,351
Okay, Jeff,
that's your cue. Get out there.

976
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,434
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,078
Go, Jeffrey!

985
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,389
Whoo!

986
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,636
<i>I'm gonna get you
out of here.</i>

987
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,155
Get away from me.
Get the fuck away from me.

988
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,555
- Jeff...
- Get away from me.

989
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,120
Get away from me!

990
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,515
You stay calm.

991
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,433
You stay calm,
you help somebody else.

992
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,715
<i>Babe.</i>

993
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,757
- Hey. What...
- Get away from me!

994
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,593
- Jeff!
- Get the fuck away from me.

995
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,319
Go help somebody else!

996
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,471
<i>Go help somebody else!</i>

997
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,914
You stay calm!

998
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,514
You stay calm!

999
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,916
You stay calm
and go help somebody else.

1000
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,715
I'm sorry.

1001
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,955
You need to tell your family
what's going on with you.

1002
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,633
No, no.

1003
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,360
Believe me, it's better
if they don't know. Trust me.

1004
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,991
They keep trying to make
a hero out of me.

1005
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,196
Does it hurt?

1006
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,114
No.

1007
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,994
I missed you.

1008
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,673
I missed you, too.

1009
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,395
I'm here, Jeff.
I'm here.

1010
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,275
I'm here.

1011
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,317
Did you have sex with my son?

1012
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,670
Yeah.

1013
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,677
Don't you think...

1014
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,433
Shouldn't you
be leanin' on me?

1015
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,154
Hmm?

1016
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,472
I wish you were leanin' on me.

1017
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,870
I'm just happy to be
sitting here with you.

1018
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,517
<i>They are so futuristic,
aren't they, Jeffrey?</i>

1019
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,399
What you have is a Genium knee.

1020
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,711
Genium is a microprocessing,

1021
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,031
top-of-the-line,
high-tech knee.

1022
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,397
Two carbon fiber sockets
with suction suspension.

1023
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,153
Deep breath as you go up.

1024
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,720
<i>And, like, you know,
you just gotta work, like,</i>

1025
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,235
<i>you know, your core strength
and everything,</i>

1026
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,720
<i>and then you gotta
stand up on 'em</i>

1027
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,995
<i>and get your balance right.</i>

1028
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,673
<i>But they're, like...
They have...</i>

1029
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,320
<i>They're like feet.
They are like feet and legs.</i>

1030
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,754
And, like,
they're attached to shoes.

1031
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,916
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1032
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,990
And you can just, like...

1033
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,960
Were they cool?

1034
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,190
I'm gonna walk.

1035
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,158
You know, I'm gonna walk
with you again someday.

1036
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,911
- Read them at the same time.
- Go.

1037
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,559
See if they link up.

1038
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,074
- "Determination is...
- "Don't be hasty.

1039
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,196
- "...the wake-up call...
- "Prosperity will knock...

1040
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,430
- to the human will."
- ...on your door soon."

1041
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,556
I didn't hear yours.

1042
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,040
No, I didn't
hear yours either.

1043
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,554
Okay.

1044
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,869
- I'm gonna get it.
- All right, keep going.

1045
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,236
<i>I'm not gonna help you.</i>

1046
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,039
You have to eat them
to be real?

1047
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,355
That's, like, a super-loud...
You have a super-loud crunch.

1048
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,715
Arms up. Get those arms up.

1049
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,234
<i>Do you wanna,
I don't know, like,</i>

1050
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,880
<i>come live with me
or somethin'?</i>

1051
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,950
You serious?

1052
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,790
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1053
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,273
You have to tell Patty.

1054
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,158
Yeah, I'll tell Patty today.

1055
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,630
Okay.

1056
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,318
She's so hungover,
she won't even remember, all right?

1057
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,750
She won't remember.

1058
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,115
We'll be living there
for two weeks.

1059
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,396
We gotta fuckin' celebrate.

1060
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,319
Boston Strong!

1061
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,272
...Jeff.

1062
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,554
<i>Boston Strong!</i>

1063
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,280
<i>Jesus Christ. Oh, God.</i>

1064
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,635
<i>Can you believe this shit?</i>

1065
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,757
We needed a win, Bob.
We needed a win.

1066
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,475
How we supposed
to not take this personally?

1067
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,710
Hey, you got a leaf in your drink.

1068
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,120
It's a mint leaf.

1069
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,157
- A mint, huh?
- It's a mojito.

1070
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,640
You muddle
the lime and the mint.

1071
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,951
You add sugar and ice,

1072
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,793
and you pour
over rum, soda water.

1073
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,280
You "muddle" it?

1074
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,476
<i>Yes, you muddle
the lime and the mint,</i>

1075
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,517
<i>and then you add
the sugar and ice.</i>

1076
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,590
<i>Hey, when we gonna
hear this big announcement?</i>

1077
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,876
<i>- Yes, just tell us already.
- Oh, when the game's over.</i>

1078
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,554
- Hey.
- Hey.

1079
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,994
Hey, so, Dale,
I need two burgers ready.

1080
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,309
Um, you take that down,
that would be helpful.

1081
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,675
Chips, too, if you don't mind.

1082
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,240
Holy shit, you can taste
the mint, bro. Try that.

1083
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,913
<i>I'm happy
to make you guys one.</i>

1084
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,400
<i>Yeah,
that'd be great, yeah, sure.</i>

1085
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,630
So nice,
you having everybody over.

1086
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,836
- Three?
- Hey, anybody that knows me

1087
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,877
knows I don't do
nothin' half-assed.

1088
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,150
Except high school.

1089
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,515
Go fuck yourself, Bob.

1090
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,590
Hey, Erin, how are things at work?

1091
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,670
You still
at Brigham and Women's?

1092
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,673
No, no, I, um...
I actually gave them my notice.

1093
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,757
- Ya get fired?
- No, no...

1094
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,160
What's...
What's his guy's name?

1095
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,232
<i>We're just taking some time,
Jeff and I...</i>

1096
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,834
- I'm gonna be there...
- That's wonderful, honey.

1097
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,400
...through the therapy
and everything.

1098
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,994
- Yeah.
- I'm moving in, actually.

1099
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,514
- Huh.
- So, just to be around, you know?

1100
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,636
Wait, what?

1101
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,074
<i>Jeff told you.</i>

1102
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,835
You knew that.

1103
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,149
No.

1104
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,270
<i>Jeff, you didn't
tell your mom?</i>

1105
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,352
<i>- Huh?
- Jeff?</i>

1106
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,591
You didn't tell your mom
I was moving in?

1107
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,275
I... I thought
that's what today was for.

1108
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,910
Like, you know, uh,
announcements and shit.

1109
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,272
Very small apartment
for three people, Jeffrey.

1110
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,670
Yeah, but technically
it's only like two and a half.

1111
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,396
That ain't funny.

1112
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,153
That ain't funny.

1113
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,709
Oh, Patty, did you give
everyone the big news?

1114
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,554
<i>What?
You told him, and you didn't tell us?</i>

1115
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,790
She didn't tell me shit.

1116
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,111
I just knew there was
gonna be a big announcement.

1117
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,475
- Yeah, what's goin' on?
- So, spill it already. Christ!

1118
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,029
All right, all right,
all right, okay. This is it.

1119
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,110
<i>- Come on, get me up.
- Patty.</i>

1120
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,759
<i>Get me up.</i>

1121
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,957
Okay, listen up,
this is how it's gonna be...

1122
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,713
Fasten your seat belts.

1123
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,429
Oprah's comin'.

1124
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,352
Oh, my God!

1125
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,589
Shut up!

1126
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,151
Oprah called me!

1127
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,392
She is flyin' down
to interview Jeffrey.

1128
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,960
- Day after tomorrow.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

1129
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,076
You're gonna meet Stedman!

1130
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,150
- Hey, man.
- No, no, no.

1131
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,993
<i>- Oprah's fat ass...
- Gayle! Oprah!</i>

1132
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,070
<i>She's comin' to...</i>

1133
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,879
<i>- Patty. Patty.
- What?</i>

1134
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,110
Jeff's not doing
that stuff anymore.

1135
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,634
What do you mean?
Fuck.

1136
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,836
- Fuck off.
- Uh-huh.

1137
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,513
- He's not.
- Come on, it's Oprah.

1138
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,159
He's not doing interviews.
He's not doin'...

1139
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,594
<i>- Jeffrey?
- ...public appearances.</i>

1140
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,080
<i>- None of that.
- Jeffrey, talk to me.</i>

1141
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,150
It's too much.

1142
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,511
- Jeffie.
- It's not good for him.

1143
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,795
- It's too much, because...
- Yeah, 'course he is.

1144
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,360
<i>- It's fuckin' Oprah Winfrey.
- He doesn't want...</i>

1145
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,954
<i>She's the most famous
person in the world.</i>

1146
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,191
Patty, all those people
looking at him, asking him questions

1147
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,310
- and needing something.
- Yeah, butt out.

1148
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,800
Come on, Jeffrey, talk to me.

1149
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,314
It's a lot of pressure.

1150
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,869
And somebody's always tryin' to take
something from him. It's too much.

1151
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,235
You gonna let her do this,
or you gonna tell me for yourself?

1152
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,674
- It's too much, Patty.
- I wanna hear from you.

1153
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,035
I'm speaking for him.

1154
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,190
You're not so drunk
ya can't speak to me.

1155
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,034
- If you would listen to me...
- No, you don't speak for my son.

1156
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,876
<i>Why'd you...
why didn't you tell me sooner?</i>

1157
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,792
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1158
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,872
Because... Why do you think?
I wanted to make it a surprise.

1159
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,078
I wanted a big announcement.
You know?

1160
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,391
<i>- It's Oprah Winfrey.
- I'm sorry, Ma.</i>

1161
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,958
<i>Where would I have
been without Oprah?</i>

1162
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,879
She got me through
the bad times.

1163
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,474
And I don't know where,
what I would be.

1164
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,676
I would've...
I would've hung myself

1165
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,479
in the bathroom without Oprah.

1166
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,755
Just sayin'.

1167
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,715
Just sayin'.

1168
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,676
So, hey,
if Oprah's your lifeline,

1169
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,154
you got a lot
deeper issues, Patty.

1170
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,230
- I'm just sayin'.
- Fuck you, Bob.

1171
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,470
Shut up, Bob.

1172
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,357
I just wanted people to see
how amazing my son is.

1173
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,709
That's all.

1174
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,520
What's so bad about that?

1175
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,033
Aw, E, come on.

1176
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,918
sorry.

1177
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,593
- E, come on, push it.
- I am.

1178
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,716
There ya go.

1179
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,076
I got it.

1180
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,713
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1181
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,870
Oh, how you doin'?

1182
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,872
Um, really well. How are you?

1183
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,553
Sully bought me
a fuckin' sombrero.

1184
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,869
- I'm...
- He did?

1185
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,076
- Yeah.
- This is from him?

1186
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,389
Yeah, he said he was out

1187
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,596
at a Mexican restaurant
last night, so...

1188
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,598
They got super hammered
and brought back two sombreros,

1189
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,955
and I got one of 'em.

1190
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,474
Lucky.

1191
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,359
- One...
- Two, three!

1192
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,959
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck.

1193
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,919
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

1194
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,480
I'm sorry.

1195
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,353
<i>â™ª Let my love open the door â™ª</i>

1196

Oh, God.</i>

1202
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,511
<i>You listen to this one, Jeffrey.</i>

1203
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,114
<i>Listen to this.</i>

1204
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,079
<i>This is from Denver, Colorado.</i>

1205
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:53,360
"You... I have never seen a stronger,

1206
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,639
more brilliant person
in my life."

1207
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,074
<i>Go to sleep, Ma.</i>

1208
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,958
"Thank you so much."

1209
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,236
She's talkin' about you,
Jeffrey.

1210
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,156
Jeffrey?

1211
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,790
<i>She's talkin' about my son.</i>

1212
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,793
<i>Hey, Jeffrey, we should go...
we should go to Colorado.</i>

1213
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,314
<i>- We should go to Denver.
- Ma.</i>

1214
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,631
<i>And go see those nice people.</i>

1215
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,315
I think we should
go to Denver, baby.

1216
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,153
We should go to Denver
when you're better.

1217
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,474
<i>Just you and me, huh?</i>

1218
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,791
Go to fuckin' sleep, Ma!

1219
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,633
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

1220
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,120
Bye.

1221
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,556
<i>I don't wanna hear
any more of those letters.</i>

1222
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,075
Don't forget
about the Red Sox.

1223
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,231
Want you to throw out
the first pitch.

1224
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,719
Look, I gotta tap out, boys.

1225
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,995
<i>I have rehab in the morning.</i>

1226
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,390
I don't want
the lady gettin' pissed.

1227
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,716
- Want some pills?
- You fuckin' retarded, Sully?

1228
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,280
I just told you,
I gotta get home.

1229
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,510
- What are they?
- Not sure.

1230
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,034
Found 'em
on my sister's dresser.

1231
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,112
You're either
gonna get high as fuck,

1232
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,351
<i>or they're gonna
regulate our periods.</i>

1233
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,079
<i>Pretty sure.</i>

1234
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,676
Excuse me.
Are you Jeff Bauman?

1235
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,240
We have been
following your story

1236
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,073
ever since we saw that photo.

1237
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,197
Then we saw you
at the Bruins game, wavin' the flag.

1238
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,873
It's so good
to see you're healed

1239
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,514
<i>and that you didn't
let them win.</i>

1240
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,671
- Can we take a picture?
- Yeah, sure.

1241
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,399
- Okay.
- Who didn't I let win?

1242
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,834
The terrorists.

1243
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,039
Can we... yeah,
let's get a picture with him.

1244
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,349
Oh, right, yeah.

1245
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,511
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

1246
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,359
'Cause I mean, like...

1247
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,079
where I'm sittin'...

1248
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,356
you know, looks like they
at least got on the scoreboard.

1249
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,874
You know,
I'm never gonna walk again.

1250
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,553
Ooh!

1251
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,679
All right. One more,
one more, one more.

1252
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,399
You don't get this picture,
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

1253
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,834
Just one more.

1254
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,280
<i>Hey, Jeff!</i>

1255
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,033
God bless you.
Thank you, Jeff.

1256
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,474
It was so nice to meet you.

1257
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,630
<i>Keep your stumps
together, though.</i>

1258
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,710
<i>No. Come on,
give me some speed!</i>

1259
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,870
Oh, watch it, I'll get him.

1260
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,235
Get him higher, Sull.

1261
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,549
He's not gonna clear it.

1262
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,757
- Fuckin' clear over your fuckin' head!
- Sull, get 'em up!

1263
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,559
- Come on, get me up, Sull!
- Get him up, Sull!

1264
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,869
Here we go.

1265
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,235
Use your arms, Sull,
use your arms!

1266
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,720
- I think I'm gonna puke.
- Shut up!

1267
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,320
- It's great!
- Please...

1268
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,039
- Shut the fuck...
- Gets...

1269
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,236
Oh, shit!

1270
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,118
Oh, shit!

1271
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,396
Fuck you, Bauman.

1272
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,630
I spilled my beer.

1273
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,915
<i>Watch me do a flip.</i>

1274
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,834
I give it a seven!

1275
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,479
<i>- Seven?
- I give it a seven!</i>

1276
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,199
<i>Excuse me, excuse me!</i>

1277
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,755
That was a six.
That's a generous six.

1278
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,354
At most.

1279
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,794
<i>He didn't stick
the fucking landing, bro.</i>

1280
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,676
<i>Oh!</i>

1281
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,035
Ouch.

1282
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,117
A tour of their facility.

1283
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,034
But I'm gonna get a...
should get a medal.

1284
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,510
<i>I'm your fuckin' hero.</i>

1285
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,273
Why, thank you.

1286
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,953
You're welcome.

1287
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,397
For finding the fucking bombers,
you piece of shit.

1288
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,120
I should not be operating
machinery tonight.

1289
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,671
Hey! Hey! Easy!

1290
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,955
Shit, Sull. Ah!

1291
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,953
Sull, didn't you get your license
yanked for driving drunk?

1292
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,872
Didn't you blow, like, a.08?

1293
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,111
Better than who you blew
last week.

1294
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,830
Hey! Hey.
Sull, no, you'll go to jail.

1295
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,075
I'm just trying
to get you home

1296
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,640
before your fuckin' wife
kills us.

1297
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,952
No, she's not my wife!
Give me the keys.

1298
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,520
Do you still even
got a license?

1299
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,876
No, they don't lose...
you don't lose your license

1300
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,997
when you fuckin' lose your legs.
Dumbass.

1301
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,594
How you gonna
reach the pedals?

1302
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,878
Fuckin' get down there.
You gonna push 'em for me.

1303
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,360
Is that even safe?

1304
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,595
No.

1305
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,110
Okay.

1306
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,315
There you go, buddy.

1307
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,995
Get down there.

1308
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,878
Hey! Watch... Watch the leg.
Sorry. Sorry.

1309
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,873
Gas. Gas.

1310
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,314
Gas.

1311
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,550
Gas, gas, gas.

1312
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1313
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,473
No!
Brake, brake, brake, brake!

1314
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,353
Got it? You got it?

1315
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,430
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.</i>

1316
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,910
<i>- You all right?
- Shit.</i>

1317
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,190
Fuckin' got it.

1318
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,510
I got it. Go.

1319
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1320
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,114
Brake, brake, brake, brake!

1321
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,235
Be my legs, Sull.
All right. Be my legs.

1322
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,993
Who the fuck's
pressin' the pedals, Jeff?

1323
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,878
Go back to sleep,
you alcoholic!

1324
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,440
Where is he? Oh, shit.

1325
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,960
Sull, I said the pedals,
not my cock, buddy.

1326
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,110
<i>What are you
doing down there?</i>

1327
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,118
- Dude, D, I got my legs back, D!
- Whoo-hoo!

1328
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,554
Brake pedal?

1329
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,994
That was pretty awesome...

1330
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,514
Let's go do donuts.
Jeff, let's do donuts.

1331
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,990
<i>- Brake pedal.
- Oh, shit!</i>

1332
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,275
<i>You gotta stop! Stop!</i>

1333
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,636
Come on!
Don't be a pussy!

1334
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,120
Don't let
the fuckin' terrorists win!

1335
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,953
Brake pedal, gas pedal.

1336
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,916
Sull, gas, gas.

1337
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,599
Whoa. Brake, brake, brake.

1338
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,000
No, go over the hill!

1339
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,231
Sull! Easy, easy,
easy on the gas.

1340
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,549
Easy on the gas, bro.

1341
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,960
Whoa, shit! Shit!

1342
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,920
Police out. Whoa!

1343
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,400
<i>Pull the car over.</i>

1344
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,550
There you go, Sull.

1345
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,393
<i>- Oh, shit.
- Pull over now!</i>

1346
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,199
Brake, brake, brake,
Sully, brake, brake!

1347
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,760
Brake pedal.

1348
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,274
Whoa!

1349
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,639
Put up your hands!

1350
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,952
Let me see your hands!

1351
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,840
Roll your window down!

1352
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,195
Roll down your fuckin' window!

1353
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,680
All right, okay,
sorry, all right.

1354
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,955
Sull, you gotta get up, Sull.

1355
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,030
<i>Anybody else in that car?</i>

1356
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,991
Let me see your hands,
too, pal!

1357
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,152
Hey, wait a minute.

1358
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,554
You Jeff Bauman?

1359
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,274
Yeah, yeah.

1360
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,396
<i>What?</i>

1361
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,680
<i>- Yeah.
- You are?</i>

1362
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,672
<i>Yeah.</i>

1363
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,240
Can I get a picture with you?

1364
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,991
<i>You, um, put the sauce in too early,</i>

1365
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,958
<i>it falls right to the bottom
of the cake.</i>

1366
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,360
<i>Look at that. So soft.</i>

1367
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,476
<i>And if you put it in too late,</i>

1368
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,994
<i>it sits right at the top edge.</i>

1369
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,878
<i>Oh, I love that.
That's a fun fact.</i>

1370
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,915
You take your pill?

1371
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,875
<i>- Did you take your medication?
- No.</i>

1372
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,839
Jeff?

1373
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,479
<i>- No.
- Hello? What?</i>

1374
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,034
<i>- No.
- No?</i>

1375
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,918
Could you take it, please?

1376
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,671
Please, please, please?

1377
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,831
Please? Pause it.

1378
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,673
- Pause?
- No, keep going.

1379
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,036
Hey, wasn't Patty supposed
to take you to rehab?

1380
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,516
Pill packer.

1381
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,954
Wanna go in front
of all those people

1382
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,514
with the noise and the lights?

1383
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,239
You'll be there.

1384
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,198
You don't even have
to be there, Erin, you know?

1385
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,875
Jeff is goin' out on the field
with the Carlos guy.

1386
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,838
It's why he's eatin' lunch
with him next week.

1387
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,956
My God.

1388
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,190
He's gonna get to know him.

1389
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,714
People think of them
as a team.

1390
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,439
No, you think of us
as a team, Ma.

1391
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,830
No, the whole fuckin' world
thinks of you as a team.

1392
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,240
- It's not just me.
- It's just weird.

1393
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,800
I don't wanna meet him,
I told you.

1394
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,394
<i>- Oh, Jesus, Jeff.
- Hey, guys.</i>

1395
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,034
God's sake,
I made the fuckin' reservation.

1396
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,600
I don't wanna
meet Carlos.

1397
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,034
I don't wanna relive
the worst day of my life.

1398
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,440
We really have to be

1399
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,590
on time for these
appointments. Okay?

1400
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,830
We got stuck in traffic.

1401
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,639
Yeah,
she forgot the sleeves.

1402
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,710
<i>She forgot the sleeves.</i>

1403
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,029
You okay?

1404
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,880
<i>Let's get about
a 30-second count there, okay?</i>

1405
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,600
Just add a little more
strengthening to it, okay?

1406
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,115
So let's start off
with the right arm,

1407
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,351
left leg for a count of...

1408
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,116
one, two, three, four...

1409
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,192
Remember, concentrate here
on the glutes.

1410
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,760
Don't arch your back.

1411
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,240
<i>This is the first time
you're in this week,</i>

1412
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,800
<i>and you have
three appointments.</i>

1413
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,872
<i>Okay?</i>

1414
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,236
<i>You gotta get in here
as many times as you can</i>

1415
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,390
- for your appointments...
- I know.

1416
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,840
I keep tellin' 'em, y'know?

1417
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,115
...or it's not gonna work,
okay?

1418
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,078
You have to keep
your appointments,

1419
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,675
and you have to come in
ready to work.

1420
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,400
I mean, look at everybody
around here, Jeff.

1421
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,039
<i>They're recovering because
they put the time</i>

1422
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,839
<i>and the energy into it.</i>

1423
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,355
And they make it a priority.
And you have to do that, too.

1424
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,510
Did you find everything?

1425
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,319
Yeah.

1426
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,959
Do you have a bathroom?

1427
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,679
We do.
It's right over in the corner.

1428
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,070
Jeff?

1429
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,756
Jeff?

1430
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,356
Jeff.

1431
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,400
Jeff.

1432
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,872
Wake up.

1433
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,189
Wake up.

1434
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,072
You and Patty get hammered?

1435
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,436
Wake up.

1436
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,552
<i>- Blanket?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1437
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,632
- You want the board?
- Yeah.

1438
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,313
Can I have my Gatorade?

1439
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,870
I got it.

1440
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,473
<i>Yeah, he'll be helpin' the Red Sox.</i>

1441
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,916
It's his favorite team
since he was a little boy.

1442
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,229
<i>Jeff's throwin' out
the first pitch</i>

1443
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,039
<i>isn't gonna help 'em win,
Patty.</i>

1444
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,110
Bruins lost that game
that we went to.

1445
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,554
Whoa!

1446
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,960
Thought we said we weren't
gonna say that out loud.

1447
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,350
<i>You see,
the fact you say that, Erin,</i>

1448
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,439
shows how little
you know about baseball.

1449
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,035
Are you...
are you even from here?

1450
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,795
- Smart.
- Okay.

1451
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,870
Huh? What?

1452
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,958
<i>- How they feel? Good?
- Yeah.</i>

1453
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,235
All set?

1454
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,760
All right, when you're ready,

1455
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,311
you're gonna scooch ahead
before you stand up.

1456
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,834
Okay, let me just
straighten that leg there.

1457
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,673
Mm-hmm.

1458
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,033
- Yup.
- Okay.

1459
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,870
Okay, scooch ahead.

1460
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,997
Okay, got it.
I'm gonna get it.

1461
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,711
Up. Hips back, hips back.
Chest up.

1462
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,359
<i>- Chest up.
- Jeffie. You're up!</i>

1463
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,557
Chest up, okay? Chest up.

1464
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,518
- My God!
- Chest up. Chest up.

1465
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,512
<i>Good, good. Okay? Good.</i>

1466
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,319
<i>That's amazing. Wow.</i>

1467
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,390
You okay?

1468
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,596
God, you are so tall.

1469
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,194
<i>All right? Okay.</i>

1470
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,999
It's a little sore there.

1471
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,116
Oh, my God.

1472
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,395
Okay.

1473
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,233
Nah, it's like needles
in my legs.

1474
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,549
- Okay.
- Yeah,

1475
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,353
but you look awesome.

1476
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,954
Good job, Jeff.

1477
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,600
Oh, you're amazing, Jeffie.
Looks amazing.

1478
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,796
It's the first time.

1479
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,030
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

1480
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,998
- I can't, I can't.
- Good job.

1481
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,400
- Let him sit.
- I gotta sit down.

1482
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,516
Okay, yup. Okay.

1483
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,149
Good job. Good job.

1484
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,232
Wheels, before...
It's gonna make it easier for ya.

1485
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,879
- Ya lock the wheels first.
- Yeah, I just... I did.

1486
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,155
- E.
- And then ya pull up the seat.

1487
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,550
Hey, E,
can you get my Gatorade?

1488
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,835
I don't have it.

1489
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,593
- Ya didn't lock...
- Fuckin'...

1490
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,670
...the wheels, 'cause if you did,
it wouldn't be movin'.

1491
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,353
- No, you still haven't done it!
- Would you back off?

1492
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,476
- Oh...
- Patty!

1493
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,630
What?

1494
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,393
Jesus Christ,
I'm sick of this shit.

1495
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,756
- I'm sick of both of you.
- What?

1496
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,354
E, what the fuck? Calm down.

1497
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,079
I'm tired of you fuckin' talkin'
to me like I'm an idiot.

1498
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,435
<i>A child is what you are.</i>

1499
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,874
<i>Okay? I am not an idiot, Patty.</i>

1500
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,360
<i>- Every time you open your...
- Ma, cut it out.</i>

1501
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,352
This is behavior
I've come to know and love.

1502
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,590
Do you understand me?
Really, I can't...

1503
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,273
I'm just callin' it like it is.

1504
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,591
<i>- I'm tired, Jeff, okay?
- Everybody's tired!</i>

1505
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,114
<i>This didn'tjust happen to you.</i>

1506
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,554
What do you mean,
it didn't just happen to me?

1507
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,279
<i>It did just happen to me!</i>

1508
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,033
Could you just open your eyes
for one fucking second,

1509
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,112
<i>and acknowledge
the huge circle...</i>

1510
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,038
<i>Look at me! Look at me!</i>

1511
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,879
<i>Jeff, the huge circle of people</i>

1512
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,633
<i>that have fucking
altered their lives</i>

1513
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,235
<i>to orbit around you. Okay?</i>

1514
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,959
<i>You have no fucking idea
how much...</i>

1515
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,713
<i>You act like this
is fucking easy for him!</i>

1516
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,473
<i>When do I act like this is easy?</i>

1517
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,279
Last night,
he's fucking wasted

1518
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,840
<i>- and covered in his own shit.
- Hey...</i>

1519
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,149
And I have to clean him up.

1520
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,435
<i>And nobody else is there
helping me.</i>

1521
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,840
<i>Oh, it's my fault?</i>

1522
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,195
<i>I have to carry him
to the bed.</i>

1523
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,600
Can you not fucking say that
right now?

1524
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,955
<i>- What?
- Can you not talk</i>

1525
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,360
<i>- about that right now?
- People are watching!</i>

1526
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,159
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit.

1527
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,800
Well, maybe they don't teach
you manners in Amesbury, huh?

1528
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,270
You say one more fucking thing
about Amesbury, Patty,

1529
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,914
I'll punch you in the fucking face.
Do you understand that?

1530
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,310
- Don't you... don't you threaten me.
- Get in the car!

1531
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,800
Go. Get in the car.

1532
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,473
<i>You gonna let her
talk to me this way?</i>

1533
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,519
Yeah, just fuckin' walk away.
You're not on the team.

1534
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,033
<i>So you wanna
tell me what's goin' on?</i>

1535
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,316
Uh, stress, lack of sleep,

1536
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,199
uh, minor surgeries,
fittings for his legs.

1537
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,475
Okay.

1538
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,994
Physical therapy sessions.

1539
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,116
His mom yelling at me

1540
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,190
for every fuckin' thing
I have ever done.

1541
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,351
I knew this was gonna happen.

1542
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,035
This is what you do, you just...
you take on too much.

1543
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,270
You take on
other people's problems

1544
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,760
and you forget yourself.

1545
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,638
Uh, what the fuck is this?

1546
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,118
Did... Please tell me
you found this in a dumpster

1547
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,873
and you're playing
some prank on me.

1548
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,559
I'm just kidding.
Okay. Uh... fuck.

1549
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,676
Um, how long?

1550
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,635
Five weeks.

1551
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,676
Does he know?

1552
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,390
No.

1553
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,358
I'm tellin' him tonight.

1554
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,199
Here we go.

1555
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,509
<i>Yeah, so I saw...</i>

1556
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,199
<i>Saw him on the news
again yesterday.</i>

1557
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,034
<i>That's good rotation
on that.</i>

1558
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,395
<i>It's like a shish kebab.</i>

1559
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,193
Burn that shit.

1560
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,634
<i>Oh, yeah, light that up.</i>

1561
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,189
<i>Give him that...
That goddamn cowboy hat.</i>

1562
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,999
<i>It's a whole event, that hat.</i>

1563
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,560
<i>He really wear
that thing in real life?</i>

1564
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,630
You still talkin' about
that Mexican guy?

1565
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,757
Costa Rican. Jesus, Bob.

1566
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,877
- Welcome to 1965, buddy.
- You know what I meant.

1567
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,872
For God's sakes.

1568
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,713
<i>I tell ya what, I'd really
like to meet that guy.</i>

1569
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,712
<i>Costa Rican, Mexican,
Honduran, whatever he is.</i>

1570
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,359
I don't care.

1571
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,352
Why?

1572
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,159
He's a fuckin' American hero,
Jeffie.

1573
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,913
<i>Not for him,
you wouldn't be sittin' here</i>

1574
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,071
<i>- drinkin' beers on my tab.
- Fuck that guy.</i>

1575
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,595
Come to think of it,
maybe he ought to pay.

1576
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,919
Hey, Jeffie,
wasn't I supposed to take you

1577
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,913
to pick up your girl,
like, 10 minutes ago?

1578
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,639
Hey, you want...
Who wants another round?

1579
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,074
I'll have one. Who's paying?

1580
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,394
<i>- Who you think?
- Not you.</i>

1581
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,550
Uncle Bob.

1582
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,996
Hey, can I just get the check?

1583
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,514
<i>What's up?</i>

1584
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,829
<i>- Can I just get the check?
- Oh, sure.</i>

1585
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,954
Yeah, four... four mai tais.

1586
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,394
Give me an order
of fried rice

1587
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,199
and some, uh, chicken wings.

1588
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,475
Yeah, yeah.

1589
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,152
<i>I dunno.
I like pizza, too.</i>

1590
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,516
<i>Don't forget my order.</i>

1591
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,311
Hey, you're the guy.
From the wheelchair.

1592
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,232
One in the picture with the guy
in the fuckin' cowboy hat?

1593
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,356
Yeah.

1594
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,033
- Yeah.
- Hey, that's awesome.

1595
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,349
Hey, you know what?

1596
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,591
Me and this
fuckin' handsome guy,

1597
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,160
we work, like, 10 blocks away

1598
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,435
from where
the bombin' happened.

1599
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,159
- Yeah.
- It's fuckin' crazy, right?

1600
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,754
Yeah, like, right there.

1601
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,956
<i>- We were right there.
- Right there.</i>

1602
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,190
<i>We saw
the whole fuckin' thing.</i>

1603
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,680
<i>- Hey, you know what, though?
- No shit.</i>

1604
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,434
Let me ask you. That whole thing,
it was a conspiracy, right?

1605
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,556
Mai tais?

1606
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,790
The whole thing
was a hoax.

1607
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,200
Yeah.

1608
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,999
It was like a fuckin' false flag.

1609
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,357
It was like it didn't happen.
It was all, like, bullshit.

1610
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,592
Fuckin' so Obama could
send us to war with Iran.

1611
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,717
We're not gonna tell anybody.

1612
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,790
<i>- What?
- You...</i>

1613
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,519
<i>You got paid
to do the bombing.</i>

1614
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,193
<i>Fuckin' Obama
did this whole thing</i>

1615
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,999
<i>so we'd go to a war
with Iran, bro.</i>

1616
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,474
<i>What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

1617
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,710
- He's got a point.
- Hey, you know what?

1618
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,234
We're already at war with Iran,
you fuckin' douchebag.

1619
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,310
Oh, yeah?

1620
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,278
- Ooh.
- Fuckin' douchebag?

1621
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,953
<i>- The fuck you talkin'...
- Fuck you.</i>

1622
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,350
- Calm down.
- Yo, this guy's fuckin' phony-baloney.

1623
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,510
- Easy, easy...
- Phony-baloney.

1624
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,034
Fuck you!

1625
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,713
<i>- Hey, come on, man!
- Say, take it easy.</i>

1626
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,917
Go fuckin' make pizza,
you piece of shit.

1627
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,990
Fuck you, man.

1628
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,549
You're fuckin' nuts, buddy!

1629
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,839
Come on!
Somebody fuckin' hit me!

1630
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,719
Fuckin' hit me, huh?

1631
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,553
Fuckin' hit me!

1632
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,797
Fuckin' hit me!

1633
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,870
Hey, stop, stop.

1634
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,832
<i>I got your messages after,</i>

1635
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,434
<i>when I was
tryin' to call you.</i>

1636
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,591
<i>That's such bullshit, Jeff.</i>

1637
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,149
You drunk?

1638
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,034
Not anymore.

1639
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,077
Were you ever gonna
show up tonight?

1640
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,436
Or were you just gonna
leave me sitting there?

1641
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,670
What is this?

1642
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,235
- Open it.
- What is it?

1643
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,436
- Open it.
- Why?

1644
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,670
Open the letter.

1645
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,233
"Someone small
and wonderful

1646
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,993
is about to happen to you."

1647
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,439
"Someone small and..."

1648
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,753
Is this a fuckin' joke?

1649
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,514
<i>No, it's not a joke.
Why would I joke about this?</i>

1650
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,475
Is this like a...

1651
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,676
Yeah.

1652
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,999
Like what...

1653
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,992
I can't do this.

1654
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,037
Someone else
you don't show up for.

1655
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,960
Erin, you... you...

1656
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,600
Jeff, I gave up
my family for you.

1657
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,280
And my job.
I'm not giving this up, too.

1658
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,794
This is bigger than you.

1659
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,280
I thought you were careful.

1660
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,272
Careful?

1661
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,955
- I can't do this.
- I can't do it.

1662
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,315
I can't raise a kid.
I can't look after him.

1663
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,840
I can't... I can't look...

1664
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,956
What am I supposed to do?

1665
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,554
I'm supposed
to chase after him?

1666
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,120
Like, I'm supposed
to chase after him?

1667
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,714
How am I gonna
take care of him?

1668
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,439
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna mess him up.

1669
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,636
Yes, you are gonna
mess him up.

1670
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,915
But not because
you don't have legs.

1671
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,515
Because you're
a fucking kid still.

1672
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,000
You let your mom
push you around

1673
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,998
like a baby in a stroller.

1674
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,400
Oh, fuck you, Erin.

1675
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,516
You do!

1676
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,193
Fuck you, Erin!

1677
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,714
You just have to show up
for once.

1678
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,916
- Show up?
- Yes.

1679
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,320
- Show up?
- Yes!

1680
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,711
I fucking showed up for you!
I showed up!

1681
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,678
I was standing there for you!

1682
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,240
- Oh, fuckin' what...
- And look what it got me!

1683
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,834
So this is my fault, then?

1684
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,354
I showed up for you!

1685
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,840
All of this
is my fault, right?

1686
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,149
I showed up for you!

1687
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,993
It doesn't scare me!
Just show up, that's it!

1688
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,756
I can't! I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

1689
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,877
Why do you even want me?

1690
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,520
Why? I'm such a fuckup!

1691
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,235
Can't do it. I'm not...
I can't do it. I can't.

1692
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,592
<i>Don't walk away from me. Erin!</i>

1693
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,676
Erin!

01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,475
Hey!

1700
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,991
Mind your own fuckin' business!

1701
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,829
Hey!

Hey!

01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,360
Open the door!

1705
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,512
Erin!

1706

Please!
Please! Please!

1709
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,832
Go help somebody else.

1710
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,593
Lay back, I got you.
I got you.

1711
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,039
Help somebody else!

1712
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,435
<i>Stay calm.</i>

1713
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,876
Go help somebody else.
I'm good.

1714
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,275
This one's critical.

1715
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,834
We need help.

1716
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,032
Hold on. Just relax.

1717
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,477
You're going to be okay.
Help is coming.

1718
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,631
Over here!
We need a chair over here.

1719
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,795
Erin...

1720
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,511
Please, open the door.

1721
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,674
Carlos.

1722
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,674
Jeff.

1723
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,597
Oh, you want one of these?

1724
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,000
Uh... coffee, please.

1725
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,355
<i>Want a beer,
anything like that?</i>

1726
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,556
No. Thank you.

1727
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,676
It's too early for me.

1728
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,238
<i>Not for me.</i>

1729
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,559
Well, thanks for showing up.

1730
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,313
It's the least I could do.

1731
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,590
So...

1732
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,716
Yeah.

1733
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,872
Why were you there?

1734
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,394
At the finish line?

1735
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,712
Yeah, I mean, y'know, like,
based on that hat

1736
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,634
and my limited knowledge
of aerodynamics,

1737
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,234
I assume it wasn't to run.

1738
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:50,030
No, no, I...
I wasn't there to run, I...

1739
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,157
I was there for my boys.

1740
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,594
They were running in the...

1741
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,717
No, no, my...

1742
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,513
my boys are dead.

1743
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,474
Shit.

1744
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,279
They died years ago.

1745
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,600
Uh...

1746
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,115
Oh. Thank you.

1747
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,354
Do you have kids?

1748
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,794
Mmm. Uh...

1749
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,795
Mm.

1750
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,676
Alex, uh, was my oldest.

1751
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,672
Uh, he was a Marine,

1752
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,150
but he got killed
by a sniper in Najaf.

1753
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,912
You know,
the way I find out is,

1754
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,196
a van pulls up in front
of my house, and...

1755
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,671
and three Marines,
they get out.

1756
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,433
But I knew.

1757
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:54,155
I knew before they rang
the doorbell, I knew.

1758
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,079
And then I did something
very stupid, right?

1759
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,870
I grabbed a can of gasoline
and a blowtorch,

1760
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,634
and I ran past them and...

1761
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,159
And I locked myself
in their van.

1762
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,471
They tried to pull me out.
The...

1763
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,155
the blowtorch sparked,
and I, um...

1764
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,913
Those Marines,

1765
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,720
they could have died,
and they saved me.

1766
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,672
The worst part is, I...

1767
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,639
I had to go to my son's
funeral on a stretcher.

1768
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,637
I'm not proud of that,
you know.

1769
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,560
<i>What about
your other son?</i>

1770
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,875
Brian.

1771
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,872
You remind me of Brian.

1772
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,634
He took his own life.

1773
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,673
It was too much for him.

1774
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,673
You know, losing his brother,
and seeing me like that.

1775
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,554
<i>Shit, Carlos.</i>

1776
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,878
I can't tell you how much

1777
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:11,032
I wish I had been there
for them when they needed me.

1778
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,555
Hmm. But now I...

1779
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,553
I travel the country,
talking to soldiers.

1780
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,917
Mostly about PTSD
and depression.

1781
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,239
I help a little.

1782
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,073
And it keeps me going.

1783
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,353
But the truth is...

1784
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,992
I don't understand.

1785
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,560
Mmm.

1786
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,389
I was there that day
at the finish line

1787
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,120
handing out American flags
for my boys.

1788
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,397
When the first bomb
went off,

1789
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,757
I looked up,
and I saw a big ball of fire, and...

1790
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,511
my body wanted to run.

1791
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:20,958
But I thought,
"This is a moment," huh?

1792
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,600
"Make a better choice."

1793
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,911
So I ran to the fire,
and there you were.

1794
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,716
Helping you...

1795
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,473
made me feel...

1796
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,120
like I had helped my son.

1797
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,391
And for that,
I am grateful.

1798
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,154
You're grateful?

1799
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,110
Yeah.

1800
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,115
You help me
as much as I help you.

1801
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,835
And I came here to say,
"Thank you."

1802
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,470
Hmm.

1803
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,159
Straight to voicemail, huh?

1804
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,471
I don't blame ya.

1805
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,632
<i>Listen,
I've been thinking, um...</i>

1806
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,270
<i>You know, our... our kid,
he or she</i>

1807
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:20,355
is, uh... gonna have legs.

1808
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,638
<i>You're gonna be, like,
a really good mom.</i>

1809
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:29,509
<i>'Cause you been dealin' with
a big, dumb kid already.</i>

1810
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,920
<i>Sittin' here, uh,</i>

1811
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,231
<i>bein' without you, it's like
the worst fuckin' thing</i>

1812
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,913
<i>that's ever happened to me.</i>

1813
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,719
By a long shot.

1814
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,399
<i>There was this, like,
there was this time</i>

1815
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,876
<i>in the hospital when,
like, I...</i>

1816
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,071
<i>I just wanna give up.</i>

1817
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,913
<i>Y'know, like, where I...</i>

1818
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,117
<i>just, like,
didn't care if I...</i>

1819
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:57,119
<i>- Come on. Come on.
- ...died or not. And...</i>

1820
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,276
<i>now I just wanna...</i>

1821
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,919
Come on, man.
Come on, man.

1822
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,474
Come on, man.

1823
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,040
<i>I just wanna walk.</i>

1824
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,554
<i>Y'know, I just wanna stand up.</i>

1825
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:11,270
I wanna see the world
from higher up, y'know?

1826
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,272
I just...
I just wanna be normal.

1827
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,994
Conference on the mound.

1828
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,480
You wanna just go
out there and just make

1829
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,835
a fool outta yourself
in front of everybody?

1830
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,910
You can't do it like this.

1831
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,229
What, I got the catcher
walkin' out to the...

1832
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,595
- Let's go, Coach.
- What?

1833
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,114
I'm gonna put him in.

1834
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,476
What are you talkin' about?
I threw one ball, guys.

1835
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,199
<i>It's your whole shoulder,
your whole body...</i>

1836
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,475
<i>Aim for his balls.
He's wearin' a cup.</i>

1837
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,880
See, that's a little...
that's a little better.

1838
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:31,950
Just... Now how about
you throw that over the plate?

1839
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,440
<i>Here we go.</i>

1840
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,830
Oh, Jesus Christ!
That's terrible.

1841
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,389
<i>Thirty-seven thousand fans
are gonna be booin' your ass.</i>

1842
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,153
You're all messed up,
all right?

1843
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,640
So listen to me.

1844
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,598
Just listen. All right?

1845
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,717
You're a bunch
of fuckin' disasters.

1846
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,280
Jesus.

1847
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,476
You got that right.

1848
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,438
But I wouldn't trade ya in
for anything.

1849
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,671
So just do me a favor,
all right?

1850
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,436
<i>Help me out?</i>

1851
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:56,796
<i>- All right?
- Let's go. Okay.</i>

1852
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,316
<i>Come on, buddy,
muscle memory.</i>

1853
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,039
<i>You know how to do this.</i>

1854
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,839
<i>And now it's just about
healing, getting better,</i>

1855
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,754
<i>and showin' the world
I'm fine and that, y'know,</i>

1856
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,320
<i>I'm not gonna let this
hold me down, y'know,</i>

1857
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,551
<i>'cause then
maybe if they see that,</i>

1858
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:12,712
<i>then maybe they won't let
stuff hold them down, either.</i>

1859
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,350
<i>And, y'know, there's always
gonna be pain, I think,</i>

1860
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,512
<i>y'know, but, I dunno, I just</i>

1861
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,512
<i>wanna, like...</i>

1862
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,034
<i>...live.</i>

1863
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,717
<i>...the Marathon tragedy,</i>

1864
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,712
<i>was a man in a cowboy hat</i>

1865
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:46,634
<i>rescuing a severely
injured man.</i>

1866
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,838
<i>The man in the cowboy hat
had lost one son...</i>

1867
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,436
How you feelin', Carlos?

1868
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,477
<i>A little nervous.</i>

1869
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,755
Yeah.

1870
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,593
My hands are shakin'.

1871
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:06,671
My boys would have loved this.

1872
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,917
<i>- Hey, Carlos.
- Yeah?</i>

1873
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:29,198
I'm gonna be a father.

1874
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,191
That's wonderful.

1875
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,074
It's time, Jeff.

1876
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,753
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1877
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,432
A hero and his hero,
right?

1878
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:34,870
<i>How are you?</i>

1879
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,036
- Good.
- I'm Jackie.

1880
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,349
How are you, Jackie? Jeff.

1881
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,715
Jeff, nice to meet you.

1882
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,280
So nice to have you here.

1883
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,555
Nice to meet you, Carlos.

1884
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,438
All right,
so we're gonna walk you out

1885
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,590
right in front of the mound and...
sound good?

1886
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,200
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

1887
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,270
Been practicing?

1888
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,350
Yeah.

1889
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,238
Go, Bauman!

1890
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,836
<i>Your boy's on the TV.</i>

1891
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,036
<i>There he is,
there he is.</i>

1892
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,235
Oh, wow.

1893
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,400
Here comes the ball now.

1894
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,359
<i>That's a special ball.</i>

1895
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,279
Hi, I'm Pedro Martinez.

1896
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,516
I think I know
who you are.

1897
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,920
Oh, great.

1898
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,559
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1899
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,994
You're very brave,
you know?

1900
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,150
We're all proud of you.

1901
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,316
Thank you.

1902
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,834
Here.

1903
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,799
You gotta show me
how to do a circle changeup.

1904
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,917
Well...

1905
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,679
<i>Go, Bauman!</i>

1906
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:58,877
Yeah! Whoo!

1907
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,993
All right, you got any tips?

1908
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:06,230
Well, aim high.

1909
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,879
<i>You're gonna be
all right, kid.</i>

1910
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,950
<i>All right.</i>

1911
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,838
How did you get so good?

1912
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,357
Let's go!

1913
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:01,315
<i>He was good under pressure.</i>

1914
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,715
<i>You've gotta give it to him.</i>

1915
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,519
<i>All right?
You've gotta give it to him.</i>

1916
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,954
<i>- He is under pressure.
- There's a lot...</i>

1917
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,633
a lot of people watching that.

1918
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,675
<i>Both Carlos and Jeff have gigantic smiles</i>

1919
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,274
<i>from ear to ear
on their faces.</i>

1920
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,194
<i>What a... what a great moment.</i>

1921
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,078
<i>See those guys coming out,</i>

1922
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,277
<i>you know, everybody
cheering and clapping,</i>

1923
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,955
<i>actually, you know,
I got goose bumps.</i>

1924
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,440
<i>I got chills. So emotional.</i>

1925
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,352
<i>The fans were on their feet.</i>

1926
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,511
<i>Wonderful tribute
by the Red Sox.</i>

1927
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,875
- It was a nice pitch.
- It was on the corner.

1928
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,076
Thanks...

1929
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,196
Either way,
I'll still buy you a beer.

1930
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,636
- I'll still get you a beer.
- No, it wasn't. It was on...

1931
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,518
So I try and do
a circle changeup.

1932
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,080
- How you doin', man?
- Did Pedro show it to you?

1933
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:44,310
Way to go, Jeff.
That was awesome.

1934
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,635
Hey, maybe
we should turn around.

1935
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:47,154
Thank you.

1936
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,720
All right, watch the shoulder.
That's his throwin' arm. Careful.

1937
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,757
I know. Careful, I gotta
protect my throwin' arm.

1938
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,876
Got a career ahead.

1939
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:52,996
Hey, don't pat
the throwin' arm, man.

1940
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,390
Hey! Hey!

1941
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,119
Jeff!
Sounds like you, Sull.

1942
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,431
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1943
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,557
Whoa, stop.
Can I talk to you for a second, man?

1944
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:03,313
<i>- What's goin' on here?
- Kind of in a rush.</i>

1945
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,754
Just gimme a second here.
I just wanna talk to him for a second.

1946
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,274
What can I help you with?

1947
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,635
Uh...

1948
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,074
my, um...

1949
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,753
My kid brother, he, uh,

1950
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,718
was in the Marines, uh...

1951
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,632
you know, over in the war.

1952
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,679
And about five years ago,
he got hit with an IED.

1953
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,638
He's gone, man.

1954
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:23,995
But, uh...

1955
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,309
Sorry about that, man.

1956
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,999
Yeah.

1957
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,311
You know, I saw
your picture that morning.

1958
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,517
You know, after the bomb?

1959
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,559
<i>All I could think about
was Thomas.</i>

1960
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:35,869
<i>Just lyin' there in the dirt.</i>

1961
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,759
I... I get so fuckin' angry,
y'know?

1962
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,832
<i>But seein' you
out there today,</i>

1963
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,559
<i>throwin' that fuckin' pitch,</i>

1964
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,836
you showed the world that
they can't fuckin' break us

1965
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,270
no matter what
the hell they do.

1966
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,919
Y'know, it...
it gave me a little hope,

1967
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,559
made me feel a little better,
and I just wanna say

1968
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,869
fuckin' thank you for that,
man, that's all.

1969
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:55,990
What's your name?

1970
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,878
Uh, my name's Larry, uh...

1971
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,999
Can I shake your hand, Larry?

1972
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,072
- You wanna shake my hand?
- Yeah.

1973
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,396
It's gonna be all right.

1974
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,039
Yeah?

1975
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,110
I'm gonna be okay, right?

1976
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,072
So you're gonna be okay.

1977
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1978
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,830

What'd you get on your report?

1991
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,080
I got an A-minus.

All right.

2000

Y'know, I did the best I could
