372
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,404
- Right there.

373
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,840
[bus squeaking]

374
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,478
- [boots stomping]

375
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,146
- What was that?

376
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,682
- Shut up with that paranoia
shit again.

377
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,884
Pass me the bag.

378
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,657
Oh, fuck.

379
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,726
[glass shatters]

380
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:51,464
- What do you have up there.

381
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,299
Goddamn!

382
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,502
[suspenseful music]
Goddamn.

383
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,570
Goddamn.

384
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,205
Goddamn.

385
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,607
Goddamn.

386
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:07,213
[suspenseful music]

387
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:23,162
[gurgling]

388
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:29,636
[suspenseful music]

389
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:33,940
- [screaming]

390
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:48,955
- [birds chirping, bee buzzing]

391
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,790
- So last summer, um,
we did a play from the

392
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,258
Book of Chronicles.

393
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,561
And I played Josiah the Levite.

394
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:59,732
And Susie Bokerman referred
to me as Jazaniah the Macathite

395
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,733
[laughs].

396
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,302
I know.

397
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,403
And then like when I'd go
swimming all the kids would

398
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,905
leave because
[indistinct] everywhere.

399
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,440
And then like I swear like
[indistinct]

400
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,908
[sounds of bushes moving,
suspenseful music]

401
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,611
like Moses walked on water
like in the swimming pool

402
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:12,879
here at camp.

403
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,448
And I like -- and I mean --
[sounds of bushes moving].

404
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,918
Oh, my God, was-was that a bear?

405
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:19,719
- No, no.

406
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,322
I'm sure it's nothing.

407
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,990
I'm going to go check it out.

408
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,759
- Be-be careful.

409
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,363
[suspenseful music]

410
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,900
[heavy breathing]

411
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,305
[suspenseful music]

412
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:43,443
[rustling]

413
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,378
- Ernie, what the hell
are you doing ?

414
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,481
- Uh, I-I was bird-watching.

415
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,482
- Right.

416
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,517
Yeah, let me go ahead
now and take this.

417
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,424
- Hey, that's not what
we were doing.

418
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,831
- What the hell, Ernie?

419
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,299
Is this supposed to be us?

420
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:06,833
- N-no.

421
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:07,867
- Huh? Is that me?

422
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:08,901
- No.

423
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,303
- Huh? Because this is a
medical condition.

424
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,437
This is not normal.

425
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,872
- No.

426
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,841
- Right.

427
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,009
God.

428
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,810
I'm going to go ahead and
hang onto this, you know,

429
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,046
just in case.

430
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,448
- I-I gotta go clean wood shop.

431
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,484
[running footsteps]

432
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,420
- I don't like that guy.

433
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,554
He seems like a major creeper.

434
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,824
Like I mean what would
he be doing -- what --?

435
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,326
Hey, wait up.

436
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,666
- That's a shitload
of weed, dude.

437
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,734
- Lot of weed for a beautiful
day in the forest

438
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,835
with my best buddy.

439
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,637
- All right.

440
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,606
- So what's your angle on that
Faith chick, dude?

441
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,308
- Oh, god, she's a prude, dude.

442
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,910
- You know what they say
about those prudes, though.

443
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,878
- What?

444
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,346
- Once they get nude,
shit gets crude.

445
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,049
- [laughs] I think we'd have a
lot better luck going to

446
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,352
those two cheerleader
types down at the lake.

447
00:21:59,352 --> 00:21:59,919
- Kendra and Courtney?

448
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,720
- Yes.

449
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,721
- Agreed.

450
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:04,524
- Say we run a little
'93 Bulls on 'em?

451
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:05,892
- I thought you were going
to say that --

452
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,061
- I'll go Jordan,
you go Pippen?

453
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:08,861
- No.

454
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,396
You always get Jordan.

455
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,398
- Aw, come on, man.

456
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,366
- I'm tired of Pippen.

457
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,534
I'm tired of Pippen.

458
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,735
- You're lucky to
get to be Pippen, dude.

459
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,804
You should be fuckin'
Luc Longley.

460
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:18,905
- Just take it back.

461
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:19,706
- M-- no.

462
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,807
- Take it back.

463
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:21,808
- Luc Longley is an
integral part of that team.

464
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,643
- Dude, at least give me Rodman.

465
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,044
He had some flair.

466
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,546
- Shit.

467
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:27,980
What the fuck?

468
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,449
[music]

469
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:32,118
- Buenos dias...

470
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,620
potitos.

471
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,755
[laughs]

472
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:36,756
- What?

473
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,057
- Fuck.

474
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:45,865
[shoveling]

475
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,800
- Shit.

476
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,137
[coughing]

477
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:54,874
- Where do you get this
pussy-ass weed, man?

478
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,876
You know, you really ought
to try the shit we have

479
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,511
down in Sinaloa, man.

480
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,148
That shit'll fuck you up,
man, for sure.

481
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:06,519
[coughing]

482
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,855
- This sucks, dude.

483
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,556
- Don't worry.

484
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,058
That's some Amsterdam
Albino Rhino.

485
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,426
He's gnawing it.

486
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,761
- So what?

487
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,729
- So by the time he's done
smoking and chewing

488
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,899
he's going to be cruising
eight miles high, bro.

489
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,834
- This better fucking work, man.

490
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,537
I'm losing my high.

491
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,572
- When have I been wrong?

492
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:30,443
- Seriously?

493
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,744
When have you been wrong,
Luc Longley?

494
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,746
Come on, man.

495
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:41,921
- [laughing] Oh...

496
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:49,962
[creepy music]

497
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,998
- [Jeff whispering]
Stack-stack the shit.

498
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,599
- [Kellenberger] More shit?

499
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,734
- [Jeff whispering]
Come here.

500
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,902
Fuck it. Let's go.

501
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,505
- Hey!

502
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,741
Hey, what are you doing?

503
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,515
Ah...

504
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,621
and keep up the good work,
amigos!

505
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,455
Eh?

506
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,824
[laughing]

507
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,229
[footsteps running]

508
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:27,133
[breathing heavy]

509
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,601
- You really think
he bought that?

510
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,936
- Yeah, yeah, he bought it,
dude.

511
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,671
[giggles]

512
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,940
- We need a game plan, man.

513
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,541
- The chicks, dude,
the cheerleaders.

514
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,175
- Yeah.

515
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:36,976
- [chuckles]

516
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,745
- I smell like shit.

517
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:40,646
- Yeah.

518
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,881
[laughs]

519
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:42,882
- Fuck it.

520
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,617
Let's go.

521
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,887
- Carmenzita.

522
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,823
Oh, why did you leave me?

523
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,858
Oh.

524
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,862
[laughs] Here, have some.

525
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:56,596
Here.

526
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,064
Just for you and me.

527
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,899
Don't tell nobody, okay?

528
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:05,671
[creepy music]

529
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,072
[kiss smack]

530
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,008
[chains rattle]

531
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,279
[phone drops]

532
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:23,623
[music]

533
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,958
Carmenzita.

534
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,895
I knew you'd be back.

535
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,162
[laughs]

536
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,838
Your hair is as
soft as the finest fleece.

537
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,240
[deep inhale]

538
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,843
Ah... ah.

00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:49,749
[music]

540
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,718
What's wrong, my little dove?

541
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,054
Oh, you are angry, no?

542
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:59,292
Surely you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.

543
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:05,965
After all, life is much too
short to be taken for granted.

544
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:09,568
[creepy music]

545
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,238
[choking]

546
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,840
Carmenzita...

547
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,110
you are much stronger
than I remember.

548
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:30,756
[gasping, struggle]

549
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:36,295
[neck snaps]

550
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,064
[head bangs against the wall]

551
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,136
- I'm tired of running, dude.

552
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,638
- Okay. Let's walk.

553
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,306
- Okay.

554
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,908
- You want the blonde
